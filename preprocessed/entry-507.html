But I really should have talked to E about our visit beforehand. E obviously felt none of the anticipation that I felt, because when I got here and we laid eyes on each other's physical presence for the first time ever, she did not leap up and embrace me or call out my name. On the day that we were supposed to have <i>sex</i>, and I arrived here breathless and excited, she saw me <i>and said "just a second."</i> 

She waved me off! 

Then we acted platonic all day; I respected that and suppressed my affections. 

I spent much of the evening in a bad place, emotionally. I felt like she and I had drifted apart, having hardly spoken in weeks. All day we acted like we weren't attracted to each other at all. I had lost the emotional place that I was in so long ago, that caused me to talk about doing this in the first place. That was before we became like strangers. A stranger who I was about to do something so vulnerable with. That's unsettling. 

Since I didn't know how she felt any more, I was so nervous I felt like throwing up. Does she still give a damn about me or is she just going through with it for A's sake? What are their plans for tonight, which they don't bother to share with me as I stand next to them like an outsider, wondering what's going on? Are they going to send me home? Do either of them even notice how quiet I am as they are having such a good time? Why do I seem to be disposable, an accessory, a household appliance? Am I invisible? 

I was not this nervous at my wedding. "Don't throw up. Breathe." This is just another typical experience for them; for me, it's a big deal. 

Arousal is mostly situational, and this was an extremely un-arousing situation. So while they stretched like gorgeous half-naked cats and ignored me, I was shriveled up like a cold raisin down there. Of course it's a vicious cycle. I wouldn't feel this way if I just knew the answers to my questions, but I clam up because I'm too flustered to communicate effectively. I wouldn't be disposable and invisible, if only I tried to attract their attention by being more fun, which I don't because it's hard to be fun when you feel nervous nausea. 

These are not acceptable emotions. "I have to be cool" I told myself. "The great thing about me is that I am emotionally stable and un-needy. The only reason I am not in the mood is that there <i>is no mood</i> yet. There is currently all the mood of a visit to the dentist. So I must not cast a bad mood over the evening by talking about this. If I just get through to the point where one or more of them starts giving me attention or affection, the hurt will go away." 

And when they did, pretty soon it did. 

I created this. I am so considerate, polite, undemanding, accommodating, and un-needy, that I allowed myself to become a household appliance who is in the closet until needed. I've let this go a little too far. 

I am going to ask for one change. When I finish my 45-minute journey to be with A, and I enter this house, <i>she often does not greet me.</i> And E didn't either. I'll let them know how much I would like it. Such a small gesture would communicate volumes to me that they give a damn. When I walk into this house and I'm not greeted, sometimes for up to half an hour, it communicates once again that I am taken for granted. "I'm too busy with some tasks of my everyday routine. I'm not going to spare ten seconds to greet you, hug you, wave and smile at you. Go distract yourself until I'm ready." Why did I not realize this before? I am privileged to be with them at all. But I need to start asserting myself at least some, or it will be a really unhealthy imbalance.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#introspection" rel="tag">introspection</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#the sexes" rel="tag">the sexes</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#relationships" rel="tag">relationships</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/129942.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-507"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-506.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-508.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
