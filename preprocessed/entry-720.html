<i>--Big Kid</i>

</blockquote><div class="ljcut">Dear Big, 

I'd be extremely busy because I have several dream jobs: 

Creating fully immersive virtual reality games, similar to those of <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/entertainment/entertainmentDetail?id=DisneyQuestIndoorInteractiveThemeParkEntertainmentPage&amp;bhcp=1">DisneyQuest</a> in Orlando. 

Making and distributing rapid prototypers for desktop manufacturing, that are capable of printing the parts from which to assemble copies of themselves. 

Running Historical Pre-enactments in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">Alternate Reality Games</a> like "<a href="http://worldwithoutoil.org">World Without Oil</a>", which I consider the futuristic equivalent of the <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>. 

Campaigns Manager for the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. 

Bridging the gap between engineers and end-users as a <a href="http://www.menloinnovations.com/method/anthropology.htm">High Tech Anthropologist</a> for Menlo Innovations in Ann Arbor. 

But if I become the sort of person who can do anything he wants, I will not get a pet monkey. That's when you know somebody's gone off the deep end. <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Tom%20Cruise%20Crazy">Tom Cruise is probably going to get a pet monkey any day now.</a>

-- Nethack Tourist

</i></blockquote><div class="ljcut">Dear Hack,

If I had to pick one thing, I think it will be the live re-enactment of the Holy Grail! Starring Davroz as Graham Chapman, Bill Putt as John Cleese, Yours Truly as Eric Idle, probably John "Minion" Hultz as Terry Jones, and many more. Coconuts will be provided, and trust me when I say many interactions and surprises will be in store. 

-Uncle Matt</div><blockquote><i>Who would win in a fight...Richard Dawkins dressed as a duck-billed platypus or Jerry Falwell dressed as Jesus, including stigmata? 

-- Palmer Eldritch

</i></blockquote><div class="ljcut">Dear Palmer,

I'm going to have to stake my bet on Professor Dawkins this time. I hesitated, because despite having undeservedly earned the reputation of a fighter, the scholar of evolution is a remarkably gentle man. 

And yet he possesses the advantage of life. Falwell is the more fearsome, but there is really only so much that can be done plausibly with a corpse that has been animated through any means whatsoever. The inherent instability of a zombie's fighting stance would not be improved by inflicting additional injuries to the head, side, wrists and ankles. A Jesus costume does not give the wearer the superpowers of Jesus, whereas a platypus costume could feasably be equipped with the poison spurs possessed by that noble beast. 

-Uncle Matt</div><blockquote><i>What's the word on the most recent potential job? 

--Filthy Lucre

</i></blockquote><div class="ljcut">Dear Luke,

I have been working there for two days, and have surpassed their expectations. The graphic and editing tasks are the sort which I enjoy. They allow me to expand my range of professional experience by applying my skills in the web. For the first time, I'm being paid what my skills and experience are worth.

Today I bicycled five miles there and five miles back, plus bicycling to lunch, with no problems. 

-Uncle Matt</div><blockquote><i>Best *fantasy* novel or series of novels? </i>

<i>--AEgideus "Giles" Ahenobarbus Julius Agricola de Hammo</i>

</blockquote><div class="ljcut">Dear Giles,

My favorite fantasy is the short novella <i>Farmer Giles of Ham</i>, a lesser-known work of J.R.R. Tolkien. I would be happy to loan it to you. I have just finished reading the first chapter of Neil Gaiman's <i>Stardust</i>, loaned to my by <div class="ljuser"><a href="http://ellalthea.livejournal.com/profile"><img width="17" height="17" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" style="border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"></a><a href="http://ellalthea.livejournal.com/"><b>ellalthea</b></a></div>, and given how much she likes <i>Stardust,</i> especially make sure she reads <i>Giles</i> if she hasn't already. I find <i>Giles</i> by far the most Gaimanish Tolkien.

AEgideus Ahenobarbus Julius Agricola de Hammo was his name, "for people were richly endowed with names in those days ... There was more time then, and folk were fewer, so that most men were distinguished." And what of his dog Garm? "Dogs had to be content with short names in the vernacular: the Book Latin was reserved for their betters. Garm could not talk even dog-Latin; but he could use the vulgar tongue." 

It begs to be made into an animated film in the style of illustration found in its pages, that style used in stained glass.

Or, as I have long dreamed, a puppet play...

My favorite answer in your series is the one given to Palmer Eldrich; however, I dare say you forgot how good a weapon a crown of thorns could be made into.  Zombie Falwell does have the added advantage that only by destroying the head can you keep him from coming at you, whereas Dawkins has multiple critical points such as the head, certain areas in the torso, the femoral artery, etc.  Does that change your calculations on the odds at all?</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3869" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3869"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>(None)</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><span style="font-weight:bold;">(None)</span></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3869-insertion-point"></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-719.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-721.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
