This is a video of Richard Dawkins conducting a Q&amp;A, mostly with students and faculty from Jerry Falwell's Liberty University.

The Christian interlocutors persistently repeated a slightly different question than Dawkins seemed to think they were asking. There are two questions about morality in their context: "First, does any such thing exist at all?" and second, "Once having settled that there exists a distinction between right and wrong, why do any humans abide by it?" Dawkins offered a persuasive explanation from evolution for the existence of a moral sense motivating us to be nice the same way lust motivates us to have sex. 

What they really wanted to hear was whether "moral" and "immoral" are distinguishable; whether these are words with any measurable referent. I can show that they are. I've discussed this with Dr. Dawkins over internet relay chat with Universists, but I'm not sure he was sufficiently convinced to start offering it to audiences. In any case, it satisfies me.

In one sense, morality exists; in another sense, it doesn't. Morality exists in the same form that economics, linguistics, and chess exist. It is as real as they are, and also sort of unreal by the same standards by which money and language are partially unreal. These are all systems of rules that people invent, within which they can conduct transactions.

Rule sets are as real and unreal as any other software. Processors juggle electricity from circuit to circuit according to software rules, in a set of transactions. We can observe and measure them, so they're real, but when the electrons stop moving in the circuits, where did the calculation go? It was never "there." It was never any place in particular.

The English language was not floating out there in some metaphysical form, waiting to be discovered by the first English speaker. Neither was the rule set of chess. We can even invent alternatives to them. Neither does morality have independent existence. And yet I hardly think a theist will carry the argument through, and say we have no ability to tell, within broad limits, whether someone is measurably practicing "correct" English and "correct" F.I.D.E. chess. 

"I can just carry on hurting people as much as I want" is like saying "I will speak my own language to myself that no one else knows, and play my own chess-like game against myself." Rule sets are not objectively real, and subjectively they can be whatever you want if you never make any interpersonal transactions with them; but <i>inter</i>subjectively they are as real as bedrock. You can carve bedrock, but you can't wish it away. Believe me, I have some experience with artificial languages, chess variants, and artificially-designed religions. You still have to know English, and you won't get many people to play any chess-like game other than Chess.

You can even say "I don't particularly like morality and I don't want to participate in that system", and still meaningfully tell more or less whether someone is doing it.

We have chess pieces, dollar bills, writing and sound waves as physical representations of rule sets. But that's all they do-- represent information systems the way <a href="http://www.logic-alphabet.net/">the logic alphabet serves as cognitive ergonomics for formal logic</a>. These are just prosthetic devices to help us measure, the way an abacus would help our primate brains perform arithmetic. I'm not sure there is any such equivalent physical device for moral reasoning, which could be where some of the confusion of godbotherers is coming from.

Yes, we can observe and measure morality without fleeing into irrationalism, the same way we can do so with economics. As with so many Christian philosophical "solutions", their solution utterly destroys what they were using it to support.

Take the argument from First Cause, which they also addressed to Professor Dawkins. The premise is that everything must have a cause. Therefore the universe must have a cause. Therefore that cause is God. But what caused God? An intelligence fully-formed at the beginning of the universe is, as Professor Dawkins so eloquently described, massively more implausible than even the weakest explanation of the Big Bang from physics. Infinite complexity can arise incrementally from simple rules through blind, purposeless evolution, but doesn't spring to life fully-formed. Our primate brains are only familiar with complicated things making simpler things, but that instinct of our primate brains is wrong.

If we are willing to make an exemption to causation, it's less ridiculous to say the universe itself is uncaused than God. At least we know the universe exists, and Occam's Razor says not to multiply entities unnecessarily. I wish Professor Dawkins had replied "Wait a minute. Either everything must have a cause, or not. You posited everything must have a cause, therefore, if that is so, God must." But that is precisely the kind of double standard used by religious apologists. They only find God more plausible as a first cause because matter and energy, time and space aren't the Alpha Monkey in the tribe, to whom our primate brain seeks to give up our responsibility for thinking.

So it is with their own reasons for declaring morality to be a meaningful, measurable distinction. It is; just not for their reasons. The problem is that the primate brain doesn't see right and wrong coming from the suffering of the victim, but coming from the Alpha Male Monkey. Just as in the First Cause argument, God results from an abdication of personal responsibility for reasoning. Right and wrong are whatever the Alpha Male Monkey say they are. The suffering of the victim doesn't matter to an obedience-based morality.

Just as doing all arithmetic with a calculator leaves one innumerate, looking up rules on a list doesn't practice moral reasoning and leaves one morally illiterate.</site-embed></lj-cut></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#christianity" rel="tag">christianity</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#religion" rel="tag">religion</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#secularism" rel="tag">secularism</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#atheism" rel="tag">atheism</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#creation science" rel="tag">creation science</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#secular" rel="tag">secular</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#chess" rel="tag">chess</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#evolution" rel="tag">evolution</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#science" rel="tag">science</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#authoritarianism" rel="tag">authoritarianism</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#christian" rel="tag">christian</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#intelligent design" rel="tag">intelligent design</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#creationism" rel="tag">creationism</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#universism" rel="tag">universism</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/151618.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-592.html">35 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-592"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3031" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3031"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 14, 2006 3:17 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526758" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_526758</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3031-insertion-point">First, I love this argument that you made in your post: "I wish Professor Dawkins had replied 'Wait a minute.

Second, on listening to Dawkins answer the question about whether atheists need some sort of organization in order for apostasy to spread, repeating the idea that getting atheists together is like trying to herd cats.  An important reminder, I think.

Hopefully, I will post on this soon. </div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3032" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3032"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 14, 2006 3:33 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/metalfatigue" style="font-weight:bold;">metalfatigue</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3032-insertion-point">The interesting question, to me, is "What set of rules (if any) governs the evolution of arbitrarily complex but substantially similar moral systems in different human societies?"

You might wish to make it clear that you are asking the question of the scientific profession, not of commenters here, unless you expect commenters here to go into the laboratory and the field and accumulate proof to substantiate their suggestions. I'm afraid there's not much better that we can do here except reference professionals who have done so.

Actually, it does.

No.  It indicates why that trait was reinforced... but it doesn't explain why it evolved that way to begin with... however, that point seems relatively moot.

I know that the prefrontal cortex is very much involved in the ability to follow social norms.  Social norms really are, effectively, the same thing as morality.  Or rather, morality is the product of social norms.  If our prefrontal cortex did not have the particular type of organization it has, whatever that may be, we may not ever have evolved a complex system of morals.  But just how specifically can genetics control such a thing?  That's really hard to tell.  There is an argument for a non-genetic component, based purely on sociology, and the "passing down" of morality from one generation to the next, primarily via story telling.  But then again, our ability to tell stories is also genetically encoded as a particular brain structure/organization, so I guess I'd have to say whatever the answer, it is complex and multifactorial, but ultimately not inexplicable.            </div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="11" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-11 comment-depth-11" style="--comment-depth: 11;"><div id="cmt3052" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 250px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3052"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 15, 2006 2:21 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_53902" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_53902</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3052-insertion-point">"But just how specifically can genetics control such a thing?

Yes!  These are questions that I'm very much intrigued by.  Not, mind you, intrigued enough to do any research or searching... but intrigued nonetheless. :)  How much of what goes on in our minds relate to chemical/genetic/structural things, and how much is the "mind" (or whatever you want to call it).  It's not inexplicable, it's ineffable, which is much more fun to say... in-F-able!</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="12" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-12 comment-depth-12" style="--comment-depth: 12;"><div id="cmt3053" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 275px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3053"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 15, 2006 2:29 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526758" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_526758</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3053-insertion-point">a good word indeed!  I actually had to look it up to make sure I knew what it meant  :-p

I can't resist answering this one.  I've recently come to see the mind as a much less ephemeral thing than I used to think of it as.  I now believe that what we call mind, and assume is separate from body, really is not at all separate from the body.  Instead it is that wonderful amalgomation of chemical responses in the brain taken together, both long-term and short-term.  All of the pathways that are unique to the individual, along with the broad strokes that we all require for life.  We don't see all of the minute individual functions, we see it as a whole, and call it mind.  Maybe in another 10 years, I'll see it differently again, but that's my current take.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="13" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-13 comment-depth-13" style="--comment-depth: 13;"><div id="cmt3055" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3055"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 15, 2006 4:06 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_21159</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3055-insertion-point">Moral reasoning is like arithmetic. Granted, our empathy and fairness are evolved instincts, but working out the relative rightness and wrongness of particular actions is a feature of reasoning. It's no different from figuring out how to build a building so that it won't fall down. You look at who owes what to whom, and who got what benefit from whom, whether they earned it, or what they reciprocated with.

Notice all those economic terms. Economics is probably the field most closely related to ethical philosophy. With money we make judgements of value. Those values are based on our desires-- our instinctual drives-- sure. Granted. But we can still weigh things against each other in each transaction. We can still count money with our higher brain and not rely on instinct.

In the same way, you figure out that stealing, for instance, is wrong because one side of the transaction is missing. We exchange reputation like currency, and blame is debt. We say an ex-con has "repaid his debt to society." One may as well ask why we "evolved to think that 2 + 2 equals 4" as to ask why we "evolved to think stealing is wrong". It's because when you take two dollars and another two dollars, they really are four dollars. Saying it's three really is bad math. Building a building in such a way that it falls down really is bad architecture. Stealing really is bad ethics. And so on.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="14" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-14 comment-depth-14" style="--comment-depth: 14;"><div id="cmt3057" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 325px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3057"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 15, 2006 12:52 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526758" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_526758</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3057-insertion-point">In many cases, I totally agree with this, but it's still a fact that reasoning comes from the brain, and the way we reason has also evelved.

I really think Dawkins should read up on psychology some if he's actually interested in this question.  I think the stages of dealing with death and dying have been universally accepted in the psychological community to apply equally as well to any sort of major loss or highly significant change in one's life.  While the loss of religious conditioning may not seem to be such a bad thing, it is a major loss, and also a major life change, nonetheless.

The stages are:  Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance.  Any of these may apply in any order, and they tend to fluctuate back and forth for most people.  I think it is also important to note that the same process would apply for the parents of said budding atheist when and/or if the atheist in question "comes out."

I should not forget to credit the late and great Elizabeth Kubbler-Ross (sp?) for her work on death and dying, as she is the one who came up with these stages in the first place.  She is also to credit for the founding of the hospice movement in America.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3037" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3037"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 14, 2006 4:43 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_21159</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3037-insertion-point">Anger can come from betrayal.

Not to be pedantic (me, pedantic?), but I think that statement needlessly attributes malicious intent to simple incorrectness.  If you had said "incorrectness-manufacturing machine" or "illogic-manufacturing machine", I could have gotten behind you.

I don't believe Xtians are specifically <i>right</i> per se, but I don't think they are any more likely to be wrong than the Hindus, or the atheists, or anyone else for that matter.  The important part is, they believe it.

Lets remember that, a lie is a statement that is known or assumed to be false... be it by overt statement, omission, or otherwise.  The key is that they KNOW or ASSUME it to be false.  If the genuinely believe it to be true, it is no longer a lie, it is incorrect information... but they are, to their perspective, in the business of providing valid and useful information.

By your definition, weathermen should be generate the same degree of betrayal... they are demonstrably incorrect as often as not... but they believe that they are telling the truth.  They believe they are imparting wisdom that is useful.

Damn, I hate being an apologist for clergy.  I don't find them useful in society... I just don't think it's reasonable to consider what they do lying.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="6" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-6 comment-depth-6" style="--comment-depth: 6;"><div id="cmt3058" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 125px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3058"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 15, 2006 1:01 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526758" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_526758</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3058-insertion-point">A weathermn is a bad comparison, because they only claim what they are saying to be as close as possible to the truth based on scientific evidence.

Did you think we were just talking about shaky metaphysics like heaven or reincarnation? Religious teachers make preposterous claims about our physical world of science, and go on believing in the teeth of evidence, because they see faith as giving them a free pass. What's worse, they encourage those in their charge to do this.

Rachel's right. There's no comparison to weathermen. I wish preachers were like weathermen saying there's 10 percent chance of rain this weekend. "Ten percent chance of heaven if you say this prayer." Instead they claim 100% certainty.

If religious faith were like the trust we place in scientists, we would not be considered sinful for withdrawing our trust when we see that the evidence doesn't point that way after all. Like a dollar bill which is supposed to be redeemable for gold on demand, our trust that a scientific claim is true is supposed to be exchangeable for evidence on demand without being accused of a disloyal lack of faith.

"If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it—the life of that man is one long sin against mankind." —W. K. Clifford

I've seen that done plenty often enough in my day, and explained the distinction to many religious people who needed it. One of the favorite tactics of the religious is to claim that deep down, you really know they're right. I'm aware how obnoxious that practice is. I wouldn't like to accuse them of it. However, it becomes difficult not to point to their own words about how they form and maintain their beliefs. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." "For we walk by faith and not..." by what? "... by sight." "Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet believe." Faith is biblically defined as hostility toward reality. Tell me how that's honesty.

I thought Abraham Lincoln put it pretty well when he said "It is an established maxim and moral that he who makes an assertion without knowing whether it is true or false is guilty of falsehood, and the accidental truth of the assertion does not justify or excuse him." Whether we call it "falsehood", or call it whatever, there is something morally untoward going on, and when those we trust practice it, it's time to be angry.

OK. Look at it this way. I'm sure you have had the experience of being convinced of something. Think of a proposition that looks overwhelmingly more likely than the alternatives to you. After that happened, how much did you need to have a weekly infomercial-style pep rally in which, if only you all shout "amen" loud enough and sing it over and over until you're practically in a self-hypnotic trance, you convince yourself that you truly believe it?

I'll bet you don't need to do that. If you have no beliefs in your life that require you to do that in order to go on thinking they're true, consider the possibility that you have never seen or experienced the phenomenon I am describing as lying. It's possible you've never looked back on decades of preaching and suddenly recognized their crowing and strutting as <i>desperately trying to convince themselves they really, really mean it</i>. Pushing one's sight of reality out of consciousness and brazenly admitting to everybody that you are doing so is not honest. So your point is that not all forms of a lack of honesty are "lying"? I'll revise my words, but it won't make much difference where the anger is concerned.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="10" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-10 comment-depth-10" style="--comment-depth: 10;"><div id="cmt3064" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 225px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3064"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 16, 2006 3:54 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_53902" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_53902</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3064-insertion-point">I think it is important to understand that I make no assertion that Christians are right.  In fact, quite the opposite, their beliefs are in almost direct opposition to most of mine.  The assertion I make regards intent; let us remember where this all began.

I find it hard to feel "betrayed" by someone who was wrong.  Other people feel perfectly comfortable being angry and feeling betrayed merely for being misinformed.  That's their thing... and I'm cool with that.  I just don't have the time in my life to waste with such (seemingly) unfounded anger.  I ahve found much better things to randomly anger myself over.... 

Science if full of "oops" moments and denials of reality.  The Cosmological Constant was adhered to by some scientists with almost religious fervor for WAY too long.  I don't get angry that we were wrong about science.  I don't get angry when I think of all of the science that we currently <b>believe</b> but will ultimately be disproven years from now.  I also don't get angry because some people teach that incorrect science today.  People teach what they believe to be true... and I can't find anger or betrayal in myself for that..  

I think the most telling thing is this:  

<blockquote>Think of a proposition that looks overwhelmingly more likely than the alternatives to you. After that happened, how much did you need to have a weekly infomercial-style pep rally in which, if only you all shout "amen" loud enough and sing it over and over until you're practically in a self-hypnotic trance, you convince yourself that you truly believe it?</blockquote>

I read that to mean, because you dissaprove of their method of belief... because you feel that their way of believing can be characterized as an "infomercial-style pep rally".. it smacks of dishonesty.  I disagree... it smacks of comfort.  I try not to judge those that need such simple, obvious things as comfort anymore than I judge polytheistic societies that relied on mythology for their science in years gone by.  Were they stupid?  No, just ignorant.  

It is plausible that my belief structure will one day be disproved.  That one day, it will be PROVEN that there is no God.  I don't believe it will be, because I believe that there is a God... but it is plausible.  It is similarly plausible that my belief structure will one day be PROVEN, beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Until that time... my assumption is that anyone who genuinely believes, regardless of how *YOU* characterize their belief, is not lying... they're just risking being wrong.

Is it pushing reality out of conciousness?  Nope.  It's viewing reality the way that makes sense to the individual.  As we adopt new scientific theories, are those that are reluctant to give up their old, not-yet-demonstrably disproven theories liars?  No, they are clinging to the beliefs that form their view of the world around them... just as theists cling to God and atheists cling to the lack of God... to change requres an amazing mental shift... I know, I once believed in a Christian God... then I became an atheist.  I spent some 15 years of my life as an atheist... and a bitter one.  Today, I have a relatively recently acquired non-Christian faith in God.  It is a distinct shift in intellect, perspective, and thought process... and is therefore resisted...

At the end of the day, this is really a relatively pointless thread to follow.  We aren't discussing the same thing.  My concern is with the mischaracterization of the teachings of religious parents and clergy as "a statement made by someone who believes or suspects it to be false, in the expectation that the hearers may believe it" (because that is what a lie is)... your contention is that a fiction is a lie... which is simply, definitionally, untrue.  A fiction, while it may be false, cannot be a lie unless it is A) known to be false and B) delivered with the intent to deceive.  I don't think that your average believer qualifies... regardless of how "foolish" or "self-hypnotic" their method of worship might be.

There are many logically valid and rhetorically sound reasons to bash Christianity... this isn't one of them.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="11" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-11 comment-depth-11" style="--comment-depth: 11;"><div id="cmt3065" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 250px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3065"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 16, 2006 7:39 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_21159</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3065-insertion-point">I do know (and have been happily employed by) clergy who I like and who I believe to be honest and sincere, though delusional.
