Penguicon 2011 guest of honor, the hilarious nerdcore rapper <a href="http://frontalot.com/">M.C. Frontalot</a>, sings about things like this:

<ol><li>"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3w1_E1V46M">We're overprivileged</a>"</li><li>"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qoGqVq9EXw">I'm destitute</a>"</li><li>"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phT0HRC69AA">Women won't sleep with me</a>"</li></ol>

<lj-cut text="Lyrics">oh man, I try to dodge fans but they keep swarming.

mc frontalot's heart's huge; let's have a housewarming.

I love you so damn much i'll sell ya CDs.

i'm greedy to get loved back like ally sheedy

in wargames. I got more sayings and turns of phrase

in my communist handbook than in my -- damn, what'd

I do with my ledger? I'll never get paid now!

that distributor promised me checks but didn't say how

he was gonna locate the Front.

it's the anonymity I'm a little bitty bit late to shun.

hate to run; can't be tardy to my rally:

"Art Must Be Free" is the decree. The finale

is my lecture on the evils of the R-I-double-A,

how they gonna sue you every single time you hit play.

they're lame! must revolt! what's that you say?

kids are pirating the frontalot? oh no, I got betrayed!

it's TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!

frontalot's destitUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE!

I need YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!

to buy my CD so I could buy FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!

I been a charity case to my fan base for years:

in tears at my show, "somebody buy me ride home."

now I got something I can barter for services.

yo don't let the major labels get word of this.

I'm girderless, free falling towards riches;

gonna sell so many CDs that I can afford britches

and a shirt, AND a hat to go with it.

I get specific -- 'cause my fantasy is that vivid.

I'm gonna buy gadgets that don't do anything but beep

and blink, then I'll go out in public &amp; buy drinks --

but it's contingent on your ponying up.

wait, you got my record on bittorrent? fuck!

might seem like there's no DRM but I'll explode

your computer like COBRA done to GI Joe

on the episode about computer viruses.

oh look, there's the ledger: overflowing with minuses.

my spinelessness in the face of the starvation

projected by my cashflow erodes the hesitation

I once harbored as regards the tune vending.

if only the nerd kids' aversion to spending

money on data got inverted somehow

I'd be making my way through all my dollars with a plow

but instead I'm down on ground on my knees

begging y'all to believe my CD isn't free.

it's TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!

frontalot's destitUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE!

I need YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!

to buy my CD so I could buy FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!</lj-cut></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/364953.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1425"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1424.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1426.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
