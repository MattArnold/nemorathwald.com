My handheld computer isn't working. And like Manfred Macx in the third chapter of <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/"><i>Accelerando!</i></a> ("Tourist"), I and those around me noticed the effect immediately. Symptoms included a complete lack of any idea what I was scheduled to do, when or where I was scheduled to do it, passwords to allow access to it, and the contact info of people I was scheduled to do it with. The patient was also increasingly observed to pace back and forth muttering about missing several days in a row of flashcard testing and drilling in vocabulary memorization.

<lj-cut>There's something wrong with the conduits from Palm Desktop to my Tungsten E device. Every time I hotsync, the computer asks me to identify which user I am, as if the device had lost all its memory. Then it hotsyncs several programs, but not my address book, daytimer or flashcard program. Several applications are completely missing from the device. At least the daytimer and address book databases still exist on Palm Desktop on the computer. I think it might be fixed if I could give it a hard reset to wipe all data from the device, but a hard reset involves resetting the device while holding down the power button, and the power button hasn't worked for months. On Friday I left the device playing music until it ran out of power, and then I didn't plug it in for two days, but after all that it still has enough power to retain all its information. I don't know what to do.

Fortunately <user site="livejournal.com" user="overthesun"> shepherded me to the Penguicon cube cleaning on time and I have now put the organized catalog and map of the storage unit on another part of my exocortex, <a href="http://wiki.penguicon.org">the EncycloPenguicon wiki</a>.

Bill participated in the cube cleaning too. While there, he gave me a wireless laptop card that he found for really cheap on the internet, sold under the name of the Orinoco chipset. That's the chipset that Linux is compatible with. Now I can return the one I borrowed from <user site="livejournal.com" user="phecda">. Unfortunately the new card was falsely advertised, because small changes were made to the chipset, giving it a trait that makes it unique among all cards that have ever been labeled "Orinoco": instead of the most compatible card ever, it's completely incompatible. <user site="livejournal.com" user="phecda">'s Netgear card worked fine under Linux, so this is a step down, but it's a step up in terms of ownership. Fortunately at the LAN party <user site="livejournal.com" user="overthesun"> installed Windows XP and Ubuntu double-booting on the laptop, and the new card works under Windows. (That is to say, it works everywhere except my house, because the home wireless network is so secure it locks out the only intended user.)

Speaking of the LAN party, we played a lot of single-player games together, but only got one game to work in multiplayer mode over the LAN. It turns out to be mind-bogglingly difficult to set up a connection with the older, unique and quirky games with personality that we enjoy, such as Red Alert 2 or Mech Commander. Fortunately Freelancer worked, and that game is truly a thing of beauty. From online guides to how to throw a LAN party, it turns out that successful LAN gamers typically use the latest cookie-cutter first-person shooter, churned out by risk-averse cookie-cutter game publishers, that billions of boring conformists are currently playing. Nevertheless, <user site="livejournal.com" user="overthesun">, <user site="livejournal.com" user="rachelann1977">, <user site="livejournal.com" user="cosettevaljean">, Drew, and I had a great time snacking, drinking tons of caffiene, laughing, talking, teaching each other how to play various games and watching each other play them. No doubt with what we have now learned, our next LAN party will contain more actual networked gaming.</user></user></user></user></user></user></user></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#games" rel="tag">games</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#linux" rel="tag">linux</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#technology" rel="tag">technology</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#computer" rel="tag">computer</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#computers" rel="tag">computers</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/99239.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-387.html">1 comment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-387"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt2020" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt2020"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Nov. 28, 2005 9:00 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526758" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_526758</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-2020-insertion-point">I'm getting you a T-shirt with a blank TV screen on it that says "Please Stay Tuned.
