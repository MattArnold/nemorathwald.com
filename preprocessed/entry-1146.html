The framework insures some things before the sculpting begins and the air-drying timer starts ticking: The body segments are sized in the right proportions for a specific character (female and male puppet frameworks have different proportions in their blueprints); The joints, weights, and string attachments are all aligned in the desired axes and planes that any human puppet should have; The puppet adheres to Dwiggins' principles which enhance naturalistic movement.

I am documenting this to show all those who want to help build the six puppets for The Trouble With Deathtraps. There are many more closeups, and drawings of the character, in <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.mattarn/MarionnetteConstruction#">the photo gallery</a>. I'd be happy to show you the framework in person before applying the Model Magic.

1) Aluminum cotter pin

2) Quarter-inch poplar dowel

3) Half-inch poplar dowel

4) Keychain ring

5) Wooden axel pin

6) Screw eye

7) Leather

8) Balsa

9) Three-eighths-inch poplar dowel

10) Waxed high-strength upholstery button thread, for spine and side-stays

11) Half-inch slotted headless steel screws, for weights

12) Wire

13) Strings held in with toothpicks for pegs

Strings will attach to the top horizontal dowel, behind the ears. That dowel will also serve as the axle for the jaw, deep inside the head. A less-important string embedded in Model Magic is needed either on the forehead or back of the head, depending on which way the head tips without it. You pull the string to nod, and let gravity do the work to tip the other way.

The cotter pin running down the center of the chest block serves as a loop for the neck attachment. Where it emerges from the bottom, the two ends are bent sideways under the chest to support the weight of the puppet from the head. I've got to leave them exposed in little trenches in the Model Magic, in case I need to take the puppet apart for work.

Chest, belly &amp; pelvis are separate segments. Flesh on the segments will be shaped with flattened cones at the top and bottom. The spine cord will run through the tips of the cones. His torso will be able to flex naturalistically.

I had to string the side stay strings through wooden axle pins, because screw eyes could not get a grip inside the balsa.

<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sqrku6o6i1I/AAAAAAAAHIY/WJa2A136Fsw/s800/leather_joint.gif" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5"> This is the leather shape used as a joint. Leather is held in routered notches, and wrapped around the dowel, bonded by wood glue. The slots in the arms were routered out with 60 degree differences-- shoulders, elbows, and wrists must bend on different planes.

The leg dowels are ground down behind the knees, and use the flat front for stops to prevent double-jointedness. I failed to do that for the elbows, so I'll have to make stops of Model Magic to prevent double-jointedness there.

I sanded big grooves into many of the dowels to keep the Model Magic from slipping or spinning, since it doesn't stick to anything but itself. Wire coils run through holes in the leather wrists and feet to keep the Model Magic on.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#puppetry" rel="tag">puppetry</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/293537.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1146"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1145.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1147.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
