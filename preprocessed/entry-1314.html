Penguicon 2011 Guest of Honor Howard Tayler's podcast is often useful not just for writers, but for anyone who would like to be creative in any way. This is particularly true of <a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/2010/10/24/writing-excuses-5-8-the-excuses-youre-out-of/">season 5 episode 8</a>. One of the things Howard says in this episode is "you have a thousand jigsaw pieces in front of you. Pick them up and start putting them together." I would like to expand on that concept.

1. Mix and match everything. Make it a habit. Do it in your head as often as possible.

2. Ask questions about the ridiculous crap that results.

The questions are the important part. Here's <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F">Neil Gaiman's blog entry on "where do you get your ideas?"</a> It was only when Neil talked to a kindergarten class and they asked it, that he realized all of a sudden that there <strong>is</strong> an answer to this question after all. He told them they just have to keep asking questions about the weird combinations that come into their heads. Most creative professionals don't even recognize when they themselves are doing it, because they have no concept that there is anyone on the planet who does not do this every minute of every day like they do.

Recently J was watching "Legend of the Seeker". I asked myself "wait a minute. If everybody's going to end up dead and go to the netherworld anyway, what's the point of the netherworld raising an army of the dead to destroy all life?" I pretended that I lived in this fictional world and had experienced this, and then I wondered about it for a while. Eventually a few jigsaw pieces clicked together in a perfect match. I know exactly why the netherworld would raise an army of the dead to destroy all life.

Look right there. <strong>That process is where imagination comes from.</strong>

While learning how to be more creative, I'm also learning how to not be so wrong about things all the time. What I've found is that these processes walk through the steps in a different order. In real life you have to gather data and perform tests. Avoid making any premature hypothesis, or you will be less likely to notice evidence which contradicts it. The real universe is inconsistent with delivering a satisfying narrative momentum. However, in a fictional story you as the author are pretty much a god, and what passes a test is not "what's real" but "whatever holds your interest", a dramatic tension that needs to be resolved. Truth-seeking and fiction-seeking have processes which are the inverse of each other.

Now to paraphrase <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hidvElQ0xE">advice from Ira Glass of This American Life.</a> As an aspiring creative person, you must start your creative life by churning out loads of bilious crap that you hate. Start now. There has to be some grist in your mental mill. In order to develop this ability, you have to practice this mental process on something, and at first your search engine will be slow and you're going to be terrible. But anyone can develop their own internal Google with enough practice.

Everything you think about is a jigsaw puzzle piece. Just like a puzzle, pick them all up and put them next to each other. That process is why creative work is called work. But if it's too dreary, you're thinking about the wrong things. What do you enjoy thinking about? That's where to start. If it helps, make index cards of everything you like to think about. Put that stuff together in juxtapositions that are either funny, or inspire questions. You guys know I like ice cream. I also think squids are cool. Ice cream + squid. Underwater ice cream truck, delivering aquatic treats to fish. If you keep doing this over and over, you are shuffling your mental deck. Put enough cards that you like in the deck, and shuffle it often enough, and eventually you can't help but draw a combination that catches your interest.

Once you've drawn a hand of cards that inspires cool questions, you have to play those cards right by asking the right questions. Every idea is a puzzle to be solved. There are two main kinds of questions. They are not an acid trip, trance, or dream. They are nothing but logical problem-solving, pure and simple.

1. <strong>How can you force the nonsensical to make sense?</strong> Why is there an underwater ice cream truck? Who does it deliver to? Is it in the ocean, or in an aquarium, or a world of anthropomorphized animals like Spongebob? Is it really a metal truck, or is it a squid who likes to gather treats and deliver them to its fish friends? Why does it do this? Watch for that "wait a minute, something doesn't make sense" moment. Grab onto that moment. "That story is wrong. That's not how it happened." Then what did happen? List a bunch of dumb or smartass answers and rank them in order of wrongness. That list is a signpost, showing you how to turn right. One end is "you're getting warmer" and the other end is "you're getting colder". Start mixing and matching closer to the warm end.

2. <strong>What is enjoyable and why?</strong> Study the factors in the mentality of the audience which makes it work for them. Every time you enjoy or don't enjoy a game, or TV, or novel, or any experience, take some time to break down the experience into its parts, look at what it was doing to your mentality, and wonder why.

The skill you are trying to acquire, through study and practice, is quickly honing down your search so you can be more productive. The creative instinct is the instinct for which questions will be most fruitful to ask yourself. Until you get that instinct, you substitute a brute-force search technique, which you will not enjoy so much, but that's why it's called creative work.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#creativity" rel="tag">creativity</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/336620.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1314"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1313.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1315.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
