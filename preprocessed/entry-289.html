This looks exciting and I can't wait to play around and experiment with it. I don't like downloading a program in Linux and then wondering where it went. Any interface that actually puts my programs where I can find the start icon after I install them will have me for a faithful user. Here's hoping it does so. I'm currently running Ubuntu, so I wonder if this desktop environment be downloaded to run on any other Linux than Symphony. Also, would a new desktop environment be restricted to running only programs developed specifically for it? 

Mezzo is based on the <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/laws.html">Laws of Interface Design.</a> Instead of a start menu, the four categories (<a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/Mezzo/index_files/MezzoComputer.jpg">computer settings</a>, <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/Mezzo/index_files/MezzoPrograms.jpg">programs</a>, <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/Mezzo/index_files/MezzoDocuments.jpg">documents</a>, trash) are assigned a corner of the screen and accessed by ramming the mouse into a corner and clicking. When dragging/resizing application windows, <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/Mezzo/index_files/MezzoWindowing.jpg">the edges of the screen are solid</a> so you can't lose them out of view. The desktop-as-folder is done away with. Technically there are no "icons" in the sense of something that can be moved like a piece of paper on a desk surface-- only buttons with icon pictures and captions. Other than the MacOSX-dock-like area, the desktop normally is covered only in <a href="http://www.symphonyos.com/Mezzo/index_files/MezzoWorkspace.jpg">nine slots for widgets</a> just like the ones in <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/cartoon/partOne.html">Konfabulator.</a> This is how it looks when you have some application windows un-minimized. (You can still put a background image behind the widgets, if I understand correctly.) Clicking a corner of the screen auto-minimizes all windows into the dock and covers the screen (except the dock) in that interface. There are no drop-down nested menus or scrolling in the file browser or the screens the corners bring up; instead, the view of the list zooms out until it fits. Drop-downs and scroll bars only appear in applications, since they've been pre-programmed that way.

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1669">Reportedly</a>, in his <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCON</a> keynote <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_spkr/1838">Paul Graham</a> said "People don't switch to open source because they want to hack the code. People switch to Firefox because its better. Microsoft can't pay people enough to build something better than the people who are building it out of love." What's incongruous is that so many in tech have denied the existence of the type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS">FLOSS</a> developer who is competing for my usage. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> kind, whose attitude is "We're here to increase open source market share and save the world from <a href="http://boingboing.net/2005/07/31/apple_to_add_trusted.html">Trusted Computing</a> domination. We're here to compete and win. So we design for easy entry for n00bs instead of just driving them off with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>." I thought I had recently been told that Linux was only intended for power users and <a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com/">TUX Magazine</a> is engaging in false advertising by claiming it was ready for the desktop. I thought I had been told that open source programmers write software only for themselves and none of them are driven by socially-conscious free-culture hippie egalitarianism. Then why are Symphony and Mezzo being created at all? The site names their mission "the easiest to use Linux experience there is." That doesn't say "power user" to me. Are shoemaker elves doing that? No, the Firefox kind of open source programmer is doing that. That's what gives me some hope for desktop-focused open source operating systems to be viable within the next decade. They are tantalizing me with promises...

P.S. As you can see from the concept images, it appears that Jason Spisak (or someone) badly needs a proofreader. Since I can do graphics, maybe I could do that for the open source community if I knew who to talk to about it.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#open source" rel="tag">open source</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#os" rel="tag">os</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#linux" rel="tag">linux</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#software" rel="tag">software</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#operating system" rel="tag">operating system</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/74037.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-289.html">6 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-289"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt1498" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt1498"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Aug. 5, 2005 1:04 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_102523" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_102523</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-1498-insertion-point">

I don't know who told you that all open source programmers write software only for themselves, but it certainly wasn't me.  I know that I'd said "quite often they are writing code to meet their own needs", but that does not imply all the time.

The sheer diversity of the culture speaks for itself, regardless of what anyone says.

"This looks exciting and I can't wait to play around and experiment with it." ~Matt Arnold

That uncontrollable urge to install and play with new distros. You Matt are becoming a true Linux geek. This is just the first symptom.

Back on topic, do you work for Penguicon for only your own fun and enjoyment, or do you work towards ensuring others have fun? 

I work for both my own reasons and so others can enjoy themselves. I would think most OSS software developers do the same to varying degrees.

Thanks

Does it still count if I don't want to hack into it? I've sometimes used an analogy that a mousing graphical user interface is like a wood and metal puzzle or rubik's cube, and a command line is like an Infocom-style text-adventure. If command line assisted me with some kind of natural text parser like a text adventure instead of just returning a syntax error I might get into it easier. My interest in distros is only in the GUI, in playing with new and different "rubik's cubes" so to speak. I admire and use both KDE and Gnome. When it comes to networking and hardware configuration, the sort of things I would need command line for, I just want it to work the first time. Symphony is in Alpha so if I install it, it might cause the computer to stop working. For this reason, I just want to install Mezzo on Ubuntu. Since Ubuntu and Symphony are both branched from Debian I suspect it might work.

By the way, I tried to download Mezzo last night with both the desktop and the wireless laptop, but neither of them are seeing the internet for some reason. Sorry to tell you that-- since you did such a good job of setting it up-- but I think my hardware is unreliable.

I work on Penguicon for my own fun and enjoyment, and also for others to have fun. You've drawn a good analogy. Penguicon services a lot of different kinds of people. Not only don't you have to be a computer geek and a sci-fi fan simultaneously, you can be neither of them. There are still some attendees who aren't aware of this and believe it's an all-Linux con that has more SF fans than usual, or an all-literature con that has more computers than usual. We've even had multiple members of concom in past years who were self-described Luddites, thought science fiction was libertarian propaganda, and only showed up to see Terry Pratchett or Neil Gaiman. I can't say that there's a lot I can do directly to increase their enjoyment, but we can benefit by sharing overhead.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt1502" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt1502"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Aug. 5, 2005 8:11 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_2191190" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_2191190</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-1502-insertion-point">i have absolutely no experience actually using any linux or open-source based system, although i am familiar with the issues surrounding the open source phenomenon (obviously).

I have been using Linux almost as exclusively as I can for about a year now, so I think I have a decent understanding of the concepts running beneath the skin of SymphonyOS. I was a 'distro ho' for a while but have settled with DamnSmallLinux and PCLinuxOS. I am very anxious to see how SymphonyOS progresses and will surely keep in touch with the forums.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-288.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-290.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
