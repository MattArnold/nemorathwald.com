Scott Colcord introduced me to <i><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/21632">To Court The King</a></i> at ConVersation. This is a dice game in which, if you roll certain combos, like three of a kind or a straight, you receive the allegiance of certain members of the King's court who demand that configuration. On further turns you can use the influence of those nobles to change the outcome of your dice rolls, thus obtaining the favor of more powerful characters. The first player to obtain the favor of the King (seven of a kind) wins.

Then during my last trip to Lansing, I played the venerable <i><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/822">Carcassonne</a></i> with <user site="livejournal.com" user="crywolf"> and Alex Duncan. In <i>Carcassonne</i>, you draw a random map tile from a bag and fit it to the map on the board in an attempt to complete the features on the map and score points.

Then I had an inspiration. In my view, the weakest aspect of <i>Carcassonne</i> is how progress is measured. Playing <i>Carcassonne</i>, you quickly learn that it's not about being artistic, just like <i>Scrabble</i> is not about forming the fanciest words. It's about the scoring. It's not bad, just less strong than the game's other qualities. The weakest aspect of <i>To Court The King</i> is the dice which, for my tastes, introduce too much randomness and insufficient interactivity between players. Again, it's not a bad feature, just the least strong in a superb game.

This hybrid uses <i>Carcassone</i> equipment in place of the dice, but achievement is measured in the style of <i>To Court The King</i>. Players can interfere more with each other's plans or build off each other tactically. It feels like these games were meant to be together.

Presenting Kingdom Of Favors.

<lj-cut text="Rules"><h1>Kingdom of Favors</h1>

This is a tile-laying game in which players build a kingdom and compete for the favors of those who live there. These characters wish for certain configurations of landscape features. When you win their favor by accomplishing their goals, they will help you accomplish more difficult goals to acquire favors from more powerful characters. The first player to gain the favor of the King wins the game.

To play Kingdom of Favors, you will need a Carcassone basic set. Set aside the scoring track, meeples, and river expansion. Begin the map with the starter piece with the dark back. Put the map tiles from the Carcassone set in an opaque bag.

You will also require favors, which represent the characters and are the pieces you print out from the PDFs provided with these instructions. (<a href="http://nemorathwald.com/files/kingdom-of-favors.pdf">PDF link</a>, 3.47MB) Print it on light card if possible, or glue it to cardstock. Cut out the favors. Shuffle the Philosophers. Arrange the favors in stacks of one stack per character, face up. Every player receives a copy of the Quick Reference Chart from this set of instructions.

<h3>  Step One Of A Turn: Drawing A Tile</h3>

To start your turn, draw a random tile from the bag.

If it matches the appearance of any altered tile on the map, put it in place of that tile. If there are multiple matches, you may select one. Return the favors from that tile to their stacks. Then take that tile as a replacement for the one you drew from the bag.

<h3>  Step Two Of A Turn: Changing The Board</h3>

You start the game with no favors, but this is the part of your turn when you may use your collection of favors if you have any. You may use them in any order. You may leave any favors unused.

An action favor can only be used once per turn. Flip it over to indicate you have used it on this turn. Action favors may affect any tile.

Triangles and tokens may be applied to change the tile you have drawn, or to change any tiles that you affect with actions on this turn. This includes any of the four tiles your drawn tile will be placed against, or any tile affected by an action favor, or any tile touching along the edge of any tile affected by your action favors on this turn. 

On previously-played tiles which you affect with an action on this turn, if your modification replaces a previously-played favor of the same shape in the same place, return the replaced favor to its stack. Then take a new one from the top of that character's favor stack, which you can spend on your next turn.

Before you finish, you must place the map tile on the board so that the edges match the tiles that were already placed. Meadow and city cannot touch without a wall between them. Roads must end at a road ending point, not at the edge of a tile. Walls and cloisters count as road ending points.

<h3>  Step Three Of A Turn: Taking A Character</h3>

You receive the allegiance of a character if, at the completion of your turn, the map meets the condition set by that character in a place that was not meeting the condition before your turn. Characters may be asking for complete cities or roads: A city is complete if it is surrounded by a wall, and a road is complete if it leads to two ending points, or if it loops onto itself. Take one of that character's token, triangle, or action favors and place it in front of you for use on a future turn.

You may only take one favor piece per turn. If you satisfied multiple conditions in a single turn, you may select one of the characters whose conditions you met. You may only possess one of each action favor, but an unlimited number of token favors and triangle favors until the supply runs out.

Some characters require one more of something existing than there was before. The condition increases each time it is fulfilled. The first Farmer will join you if there exists a meadow touching precisely one city, no more or less. The second seeks a meadow touching two cities, no more or less. The third, three cities, and so forth. The number goes up for all players when anyone fulfills the condition. Conditions that used to exist but no longer exist do not count

toward these characters. For instance, the Bishop requires an increasing number of surrounded cloisters. Although it is acceptable to have more surrounded cloisters than the current number necessary, the cloisters must all be surrounded at the same time.

Play now passes to the next player.
