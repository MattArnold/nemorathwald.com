Congratulations to the designer, Ross Atkinson.

Here is the feedback I received for the game I entered, "Ingeniators".

<table border="1" style="border-style:none"><tbody><tr><td>Scoresheet criterion, on a scale of one to ten. Each column is 1 of the 7 playtesters.</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>1.

I could see some gamers over-analyzing what they should do &amp; taking a lot of time. I wonder how easy it is to self-exploit his own invention for points but that might be resolved with others flipping/clearing the tracks... so might be OK.</li><li>There are some little tweaks that would be very helpful, like the scoring mechanism and the stacks of tiles. Both are very easy to knock over.</li><li>Definite potential.</li><li>The pieces were kind-of hard to tell apart. It was fun but it hurt my brain a bit.</li><li>Very cerebral, almost to the point of causing brain malfunction.</li><li>Overall this was fun!</li></ul></em></blockquote>The message is unambiguous. While the game I designed appeals strongly to its own target market (such as playtesters # 5 &amp; 7), there is clearly a need for a more casual version. Many of the playtesters were grandparents and teens who didn't seem engaged.

After I received this feedback, it didn't take me long to condense Ingeniators down to its purest recognizable form. Unfortunately this version loses the thing I liked about it the most: self-interested co-operation. But it's still fun.

The other thing I learned is that few people are confident in how Ingeniators should be pronounced. (In-Jee-Nee-Ay-Ters.) This feedback came exclusively from folks who I know to be highly literate.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#games" rel="tag">games</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#game" rel="tag">game</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/341012.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1332"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1331.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1333.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
