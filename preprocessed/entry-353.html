Cafe <a href="http://www.penguicon.org/">Penguicon</a> and the <a href="http://www.con-versation.com/">ConVersation</a> party were both great successes at <a href="http://www.conclavesf.org/">ConClave</a>.

Both conventions got many pre-registrations at their room parties, and a great time was had by all. We partied Friday and Saturday nights. In addition to the whole-bean freshly-ground coffee and espresso, Cafe <a href="http://www.penguicon.org/">Penguicon</a> served the home-made fudge for which Kimba "The Fudge Goddess" is renowned. In honor of the latest addition to our guest of honor list, we featured a new flavor, "Google Fudge"!

<a href="http://www.conclavesf.org/">ConClave</a> has been going thirty years, and despite the definition of the word "conclave" has never elected a pope. This year the <a href="http://www.con-versation.com/">ConVersation</a> room party had an event in which we did so. Sadly for <user site="livejournal.com" user="palindromeg33k">, who wanted the position very much, he came in a distant second to the door of the hotel room. <a href="http://www.forum2.org/tal/books/dirk.html">The door was the way to... to... The Door was The Way.</a> Since the pope costume and hat was unable to fit on the door, we gave them to <user site="livejournal.com" user="palindromeg33k">, who was dubbed AntiPope and blessed the balloon herding event as a huge cloud of balloons were pushed out of the ConSuite, down the hall, into the elevators, and into the ballroom for the dance.

Tux the Penguin put in a brief appearance. Tux wanted to meet Dr. Kage because of the "furry" connection, and although I (as Tux's agent and co-ordinator) am not into that, I felt it was appropriate. But due to poor timing that meeting was fated not to be.

I loved the panel "Fun With Liquid Nitrogen." After that event I got a pair of volunteers to bring liquid nitrogen to <a href="http://www.penguicon.org/">Penguicon</a> and make liquid nitrogen ice cream in the consuite! Another panel I enjoyed very much was the discussion of Disney by Bill "Aksel" Kuehl and <user site="livejournal.com" user="paranthropus">. I knew <user site="livejournal.com" user="paranthropus"> was a fantastically talented animator but until I looked through his portfolios it had not quite sunk in how stunningly accomplished he has been.

It's a three-year tradition for me after paying for the hotel room on Sunday to buy a book in the dealer's room at <a href="http://www.conclavesf.org/">ConClave</a>. But this year I didn't have cash. The minimum purchase to use credit was absurdly high, so I went completely overboard on <user site="livejournal.com" user="cosette_valjean">'s credit card. In my insane, giddy spree I actually had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765346753/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">nine</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765308835/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">or</a>   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076534906X/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">ten</a> science fiction novels on the checkout pile, until she pointed out I already had enough. I culled the list down to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812576357/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Ventus</a> by <a href="http://www.kschroeder.com/">Karl Schroeder</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441011594/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Iron Sunrise</a> by <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/">Charlie Stross</a> (<user site="livejournal.com" user="antipope">), and two <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/">Robert Sawyer</a> novels, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765345005/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Hominids</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812580354/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Calculating God</a>. I owe <user site="livejournal.com" user="cosette_valjean"> lots of money. With apologies to the Popeye character Wimpy, "I'd gladly pay you Friday for a library today." Fortunately <user site="livejournal.com" user="cosette_valjean"> is only too happy for me to get mind-bending science fiction novels because I'll either tell her the complete story or actually read it aloud to her.

I like being with a rare woman who is interested in that. :)

<lj-cut text="Thoughts about Karl Schroeder's Ventus. Spoiler warning.">It's fascinating how <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812576357/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Ventus</a> explores fairy-tale tropes and finds ways to justify them with advanced technology. I am not merely speaking of Arthur C. Clarke's quote "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." That magic could take any form, from Anime creatures to the rain of "the multicolored sporks of revolution" in Charlie Stross's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441011799/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Singularity Sky</a>. There is no necessary reason for it to take the form of the tropes of the Brothers Grimm, such as undeads, medieval apprentices seeing visions, forests of dangerous trees, or empty houses kept clean and welcoming by furniture that alternately serve their guests and attack them. By positing mature nanotechnology and AI, it would be easy and unimpressive to depict this as merely <i>possible</i>. The trick is to depict an origin that is <i>motivationally</i> justified in a plausible history. <a href="http://www.kschroeder.com/">Karl Schroeder</a> is actually acheiving this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812576357/002-1219707-2644868?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance">Ventus</a>.</lj-cut></user></user></user></user></user></user></user></user></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#conventions" rel="tag">conventions</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#disney" rel="tag">disney</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#coffee" rel="tag">coffee</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#conclave" rel="tag">conclave</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#animation" rel="tag">animation</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#literature" rel="tag">literature</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#science fiction" rel="tag">science fiction</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#sf" rel="tag">sf</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#charlie stross" rel="tag">charlie stross</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#penguicon" rel="tag">penguicon</a>, </li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/90399.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-353.html">1 comment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-353"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt1766" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt1766"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title">Awwww, you are sooo sweet!</h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Oct. 12, 2005 4:19 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_528962" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_528962</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-1766-insertion-point">You have a wonderful talent for telling stories whether from imagination, memory or book.
