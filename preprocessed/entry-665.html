This afternoon I interviewed with the job I mentioned in <a href="http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/177282.html">my post on the 25th.</a> They were extremely impressed with my portfolio and experiences. As I have said, the tasks are perfectly aligned to me. They don't stretch me at all and will allow me to be safely within a comfort zone. That's good, because I've stretched myself enough for 2007 and am ready to stop the stress and depression that comes with it. I'll stretch myself past my limits some more later and try to extend the breaking point. I plan to start on Thursday after they've asked their CEO to approve the radical idea of not having me to go a temp agency tomorrow to apply for this job. 

I stopped by Ideal Solution while I was in Lansing and thanked Jeff for the reference. I'm still going to do web development for them on the side, but I'll miss working with people I like. The company I interviewed with has a stodgy suit-and-tie dress code, a 7:30 AM start time and won't let me telecommute even though they admit I could do so, and I could do the job better with my own software and setup. 

<user site="livejournal.com" user="cosette_valjean"> broke into tears at the announcement of the job offer. A few weeks ago it looked like I would move in with her in Hazel Park, and <user site="livejournal.com" user="overthesun"> and <user site="livejournal.com" user="rachelann1977"> would move in downstairs. She would have an arrangement that almost felt like a family. Then <user site="livejournal.com" user="overthesun"> lost his job, and my new job wasn't working out. Now it appears I'll have to get a couch to crash on in Lansing or Brighton and hardly see the people who matter to me the most, all of whom are out east. She took me out to eat and tried to be positive, but it was too tearful to be a celebration. I'm getting a job for a paltry $26,000 which I know from experience is not enough money to live on, and would involve a choice between $100 a week in gas or exile from everything I care about and a serious risk of losing those I love. 

The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People distinguishes between urgency and importance; between external pressures and internal motivations. Taking this job solves my urgent crisis, satisfying the external pressures of security with which to pay my catastrophic $2,000 in taxes. It offers nothing of any importance. 

I was strong until she wept. Then the depression I had held at bay won its months-long battle. I feel a crushing sensation in my body. I want to fall asleep. 

Please keep your ears out for more job leads for me. Between a 40-hour a week job and three hours of driving every day, I'm not going to have time to ship out my resume, so <user site="livejournal.com" user="cosette_valjean"> will be doing it for me. Also, please keep me and all those who are in my life in your thoughts. If you believe in something to pray to and you want to pray, that's fine.</user></user></user></user></user></lj-cut></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/170430.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-665.html">2 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-665"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3619" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3619"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>May. 2, 2007 6:25 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_344389</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3619-insertion-point">It's good that you did not trade your relationship for a job.

Hey friends who work in IT

May. 1st, 2007 at 11:44 AM 

I just received a call from a recruiter who works with some of the larger companies around town (BCBS, Comerica, Compuware, etc) and while I'm not looking for a new job, I figured I'd post his information for anyone who might be looking. :)

He seemed really nice and I liked the fact that they don't recruit you into the automotive field, it's just a pet peeve of mine after having worked in that rollercoaster of a ride myself. 

Hope this is helpful to someone! :)</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-664.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-666.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
