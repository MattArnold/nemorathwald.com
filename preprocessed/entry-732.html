<div class="ljcut">

On Saturday the guy from the collection agency&nbsp;trying to collect my $2400 in credit card debt used a different number to call me, so I picked up.&nbsp;I told him I'm employed now so I'll be able to pay him, but I was not at home&nbsp;so I didn't have my financial projections in front of me.&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;when I looked at the spreadsheet I could&nbsp;tell him how much I could save up by what dates, so he could take it to the client to see if they'd accept it as a settlement. How much they get depends on how long they're willing to wait. He told me to call back with that info.

When he asked who I work for, I told him, which may have been a mistake. However, I gave him the name of the company which is my workplace. That company&nbsp;is the client of my real employer, the temp agency, and I get my paychecks directly from the temp agency. If they&nbsp;garnish my wages, they'd have to do it from the agency, whose name they don't know. The cost of&nbsp;legal fees to go through the court system to garnish my wages is probably more than the actual amount I owe.

Today I called back as agreed, just because I'm the kind of guy who acts in good faith. My call was diverted to this guy's&nbsp;(alleged) supervisor. I told him what the other guy and I had agreed. He told me&nbsp;he was refusing my settlement schedule, and that the only offer on the table is for me to pay today or tomorrow (bull), and that unless I got a friend to pay it by credit card during that time I would be listed as a refusal. When I said that's not going to happen, he said good luck and hung up on me. I'm sure they have an entire script for this, and that anyone who gives them a call back must be weak and afraid, hence the good-cop&nbsp;bad-cop act.

I'm sure he's actually a smart guy who deals with stupid people all day. Because he is smart he has learned that if he puts a sock puppet on his hand and has it recite statements, those statements will get him what he wants. Never mind that&nbsp;saying "if you think you can walk away from this, you're wrong", to a guy who had just picked up the phone and&nbsp;<em>initiated</em> a call to him, is a dumb statement; reciting it must be efficacious in most cases.&nbsp;They know&nbsp;I want to give them their money. But from their perspective,&nbsp;what does it cost them to go ahead and hassle me until then?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/187598.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-732.html">29 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-732"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3910" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3910"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 24, 2007 2:16 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_258792" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_258792</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3910-insertion-point">Hi Matt,

I just recently watched a documentary called "Maxed Out".  Very eye opening regarding the practice of these sleazeball collection agencies, and credit card companies.  You should be able to rent it from block busters if you'd like.

Also, I recommend listening to Dave Ramsey.  Go to www.daveramsey.com.  He is great to listen to, and offers great financial advice!  I believe that he has said that as long as you send the collection agencies what you can, and then provide an explanation that they are unlikely to take action against you.  He has pod-casts on line that you can download, and you might even be able to call his show to get advice on this.

I think that they're just trying to bully you so that you will do something rash!  Just keep your head and stick to your plan.  And good luck, Matt!!!</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3916" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3916"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 24, 2007 3:32 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_21159</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3916-insertion-point">My parents are a big fan of Dave Ramsey. They took all their kids, including me, to his seminar a couple of years ago. That's where I got my three step plan of debt elimination, emergency fund, and reliable used car.

The one place where his advice was not able to help me was that he seemed to imply that I should only think about my outgo, not my income. I think a lot of people get that wrong and only increase their income when they should be reducing their outgo, but he didn't mean that for all cases. In my case, I had no expenses left to cut and the only solution was to get a job that pays enough to live on.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3940" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3940"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 25, 2007 8:22 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_344389</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3940-insertion-point">Just rented and watched Maxed Out.

§ 805. Communication in connection with debt collection   [15 USC 1692c]</b>

(a) COMMUNICATION WITH THE CONSUMER GENERALLY.  Without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, a debt collector may not communicate with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt --

(1) at any unusual time or place or a time or place known or which should be known to be inconvenient to the consumer. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a debt collector shall assume that the convenient time for communicating with a consumer is after 8 o'clock antimeridian and before 9 o'clock postmeridian, local time at the consumer's location;

(2) if the debt collector knows the consumer is represented by an attorney with respect to such debt and has knowledge of, or can readily ascertain, such attorney's name and address, unless the attorney fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to a communication from the debt collector or unless the attorney consents to direct communication with the consumer; or

(3) at the consumer's place of employment if the debt collector knows or has reason to know that the consumer's employer prohibits the consumer from receiving such communication.</i></blockquote>

Matt, when you fire off that letter to the vultures, you need to make it clear that you are not permitted to receive outside phone calls. 

One other thing I forgot to mention below. When you send mail to the collection agency send them two copies of each. One priority mail with delivery confirmation, the other registered mail return receipt requested. That is the one that requires a signature. 

Even if they refuse to sign for the registered one, you still have proof they got it.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt3912" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3912"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 24, 2007 2:25 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_25108" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_25108</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3912-insertion-point">Call display.

Alternatively, it sounds like you're good at negotiating and are financially organized enough at the moment to be able to negotiate directly with your debtors, rather than dealing with asshole collections agencies. I'd bet there are resources on the internet for doing just that, and then you could use the otherwise credit counseling "administrative" fee to pay down the debt faster.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3914" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3914"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 24, 2007 3:15 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_124505" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_124505</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3914-insertion-point">Credit counseling often does worse things to your credit rating than bankruptcy does, simply because bankruptcy remains an option afterward.  If you can negotiate on your own, it's better to do so.  Also, be aware that some credit counseling agencies are run and/or funded by credit card companies, so they will counsel you to pay your credit cards first, above other creditors, regardless of whether that's really your best option or not.

One thing you may want to consider, even though it goes against your nature: save up money until you have a good chunk, and THEN offer that chunk as a settlement instead of a payment plan.  Credit card companies don't want to lose their investment (i.e., the charges you actually made that they paid the merchant for), but they're usually more willing to negotiate on the profit (i.e., the interest that's been piling up on those charges you made).  With a payment plan, they still risk the investment, because there's no guarantee you're going to make the next installment.  Plus, the interest still accrues.

If you're stuck dealing with the collections agency, learn a bit about how they work so you know what they're looking to get out of it (other than the obvious: "money").  My knowledge here is sketchy, but I know that there are two general types of collection agencies.  One type works on a "finder's fee", where the debt remains with the initial creditor and the collection agency gets a cut of what they collect.  The other type works on "factoring", where they buy the debt outright for pennies on the dollar.

Alas, your decision to reveal where you work was not a good one. 

First words of advice: [b]Do not tell them anything!!![/b] 

Keep always in your heart this person is not your friend. Their job is to get ammunition to use against you with the goal of separating you from your money. No matter how much they threaten, whine, posture, promise, make like your friend, offer to introduce you to their finance manager, or whatever fantasy they put forth, giving them information can only hurt you. 

[b]The following is extremely important![/b]

Next time you talk to them, you need to tell them your temp job ends at the end of the week. Or tell them the job plain and simply did not work out and they are going to have to wait longer for their money. 

Or better yet, tell them you will be getting more money as you dumped this job to go work as a scab at an auto-plant. 

Tell them anything to throw them off the trail of this present job.

I'm not certain how well you know and get along with the HR people who's name you gave. They can legally say you do not work for them. However, without a heads up, it is not too much of a stretch to have the HR person tell anyone calling for a "credit check" who you do work for.

Do not feel bad about lying to these slime balls. They will tell you almost anything to rope you into paying them. 

[B]Why this is a problem[/b]

If the collection agent knows where you work, they now have a place to serve papers on you. Once you are served, they can sue you. Unless something really unusual is in play here, they will win. 

Once they have a judgment against you and you cannot write a check for the full amount on the spot, they would be fools not to ask for an execution of judgment. The judge will grant it, almost by default. 

That little trick allows them to issue court rubber stamped paperwork allowing them to attach all but minimum wage from your pay check, seize entire bank accounts and even cause the sheriff to drop by your house to collect personal items for sale at auction. (That includes computers and no they will not give you time to wipe the hard drive.)

The garnishment of wages is most likely. Bank account garnishment is a close second. The last part about seizing personal property is last resort rare behavior, however it can and does happen depending on the amount of the debt.

[b]General advice[/b]

They may try to get you to come into the office to sign a "payment agreement." Don't do it. You could come in only to have them hand you civil suit papers.

Don't sign anything they send you. 

Don't accept any certified, registered or return receipt requested mail.

Go to this address, http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpa/fdcpact.htm and study it until you understand every word. 

This address, http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/money/fair-debt/fair-dbt.htm explains some of the law in English. You should study it as well.

Get a post office box. The physical address you give to the post office should not be the address you can actually be found at. Use a friend's address. That way they cannot use the information to get you legally served. 

Compose a letter to the collection agent. If you are within the 30 days, dispute the claim. If nothing else, dispute the amount and the way he interest was calculated. Even if you are not within the 30 day dispute period, demand a written accounting and verification of the debt. 

Either or both of these actions will stall the collection procedure and possibly allow you to start saving toward sending them a partial payment.

Establish a separate checking account specifically to pay collection agencies from. This needs to be in a completely separate banking company from the one you currently use. A separate branch of the same bank will not do the trick. If you write a check from your current account, the evil bastards will know where to serve garnishment papers. 

There are many more tricks to dealing with these folks. I got my education when I had a heart attack and died briefly. The health insurance company died the next month. Alas, it did not come back to life.

Drop me an e-mail and I'll send you my phone number. I'll be happy to pass along the education I received at the college of hard knocks.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3925" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3925"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 24, 2007 7:46 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_21159</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3925-insertion-point">What do you think are the odds that they will pay all those lawyer's fees and court costs to get a mere $2400 that they have a good reason to expect me to pay one month from now?

That is because you agreed to pay all costs when you signed your credit agreement. I strongly recommend you drag it out and read it.

Tell them you don't make electronic payments. 

DO NOT give them any personal information. You should not have told them you were employed. 

If you make so much as a $10 payment, they then are not supposed to contact you for some period of time; it was 30 days in Illinois, but I'm not sure what it is in Michigan. You can tell them not to call you; that you will only respond to written communication, with written communication. 

*They* want *your* money. Don't forget that. They think they will get it faster by harrassing you, because you'll pay them in order to get them to go away.

Ask to speak to the collections department. Tell them you are prepared to pay the debt in full plus reasonable interest. 

Explain that you lost your job, but are now working free lance and have have the resources to pay them. Tell who ever you talk to that you are unhappy with the collection agency's tactics and abusive nature. 

Ask if they would pull it back from the collection agency and allow you to pay them directly. Tell them you would like to keep the collection account from showing on your credit record and are not really fond of the idea of giving the sneaking lying bastards any of your money. 

Do a little begging and pleading, you may have to offer to pay the current balance and then catch the interest up. Suggest that you are trying to re-establish your credit rating after the job loss. 

The worse that can happen is they can say no.

I agree that you should pay the debt ASAP; delayed payment is a way of prolonging *their* agony. </div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="4" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-4 comment-depth-4" style="--comment-depth: 4;"><div id="cmt3933" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 75px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3933"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 25, 2007 12:18 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_344389</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3933-insertion-point">Great web site.

You can request that they not call you and then they can only send you mail. That will head off the awkward work phone calls.

I would say call them back, ask for a hefty discount along with a payment plan, and when they give you a hassle, tell them they have the choice of taking some money or you won't be talking to them again and they won't be allowed to call you either. Put the pressure right back at them.

I work as a contractor at a bank just one cube row over from the collections people. Very rude indeed. It's funny listening to it but I know it isn't funny to the people they talk to. Because of how they are, I'm never doing business with them.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3938" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3938"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>(None)</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_344389</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3938-insertion-point"></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt3939" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt3939"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Sep. 25, 2007 2:38 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_344389</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-3939-insertion-point"><b><i>"Dawnwolf was right.

Keep always in your heart that you have to do that in writing. Verbal commands like that do not work.

Interesting plan, but with one major flaw. Keep always in your heart these bastards can sue when ever the mood suits them. They don't even have to write you a letter first.

Best not to poke the beast with a sharp stick while you are vulnerable.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-731.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-733.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
