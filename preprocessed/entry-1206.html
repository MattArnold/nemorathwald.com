1. Clay Shirky wrote <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/">a blog post about how fewer women than men are self-aggrandizing jerks</a>. A relevant quote:<blockquote>They aren’t just bad at behaving like arrogant self-aggrandizing jerks. They are bad at behaving like self-promoting narcissists, anti-social obsessives, or pompous blowhards, even a little bit, even temporarily, even when it would be in their best interests to do so. Whatever bad things you can say about those behaviors, you can’t say they are underrepresented among people who have changed the world.</blockquote>His blog post is full of tales of bad-faith deals, slick lies, and risks they have taken with the trust that others wrongly placed in them. He considers that praiseworthy. You can keep it, Clay.

2. After a street harassment blogathon about things guys should never do when approaching a woman in the street (after which I marveled at how sheltered I have been, that such behavior is simply unthinkable in the bubble in which I am ensconced), Fugitivus posted <a href="http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/street-luv/">a list of success stories to stand in contrast</a>.

They don't seem like success stories. The guys in these stories act like their attraction is newsworthy. These are the success stories? Some of them resulted in the woman feeling nice afterward, but who can predict whether that will happen? Context or age or sexual preference or a bad day could make the difference between whether you go on the uplifting list or the exploitative list. Factors outside of you, which you can't perceive or control, but will still be responsible for. So why do it?

Male or female, I just never approach strangers, because they have entered the coffee shop or the street or the bookstore in order to go about their business, which does not include socializing. Perhaps some strangers enjoy random human contact. I'll never know which ones.

As a strategy, UMIS (Unwanted Male Interest Syndrome) seems both unnecessary and futile. A better strategy is to do cool things in public. I deliberately put myself in positions that give strangers an excuse to approach <i>me</i>. (I am terrible at parties, but do well when sitting behind an official table of some kind.)

1. Put one's self in interactive contexts.

2. Befriend those with common ground.

3. ????

4. Profit!

It is unnecessary to treat 1 and 2 as if they were goal-oriented toward 3 and 4. Things lead where they are going to lead, if they are going to lead anywhere at all. Perhaps a more aggressive strategy would have gotten me all kinds of laid. But I doubt it, and I have no complaints about the frequency and quality with which I am already laid, so what would be the point?

I guess for them it really is about proving their manhood. I never thought about that kind of thing. I see no action item for me here. I'm not sure if there's anything I can do about all the catcalling. I'm not going to take on a secret identity and a costume or something and go out fighting street harassment.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/308978.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-1206.html">8 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1206"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt5867" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt5867"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Jan. 21, 2010 5:16 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_26596" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_26596</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-5867-insertion-point">On Clay Shirky: if the social norm in a subculture is self-aggrandizement, then (1) decision-makers know to correct for that, and (2) anyone who doesn't do it has the same correction applied and will be seen as believing themselves to be less competent than those who do.

However, it's not just a matter of women being unwilling to exaggerate their talents -- women will often minimise or even omit their genuine accomplishments for fear of sounding like they're bragging, even when it's true and may generate the positive interest they're looking for.  The best example from the article is the woman who said "Hey, you should write about my stuff".  Clearly her work was good -- it wasn't simply an exaggeration, otherwise the writer would have ignored it over the hundreds of other people vying for attention.  But the fact that no other woman was willing to bring attention to her own work, even just to say "Look at it and come to your own conclusion" is very telling of the problem.

Pardon me, Matt, while I steal your body for a comparison and contrast example between legitimate self-promotion (and the benefits it brings) and what I've seen many women do (including myself)**:

<blockquote>

<b>Matt:</b> Did I hear the word "geek"?  I'm the former ConChair of Penguicon, which is this *amazing* convention for geeks of all types -- computer geeks, gaming geeks, SF/fantasy, anime, Steampunk...And it's huge!  There are lots of things to do, lots of people there.  And liquid nitrogen ice cream and singing Tesla coils.  You'd fit right in!

[New person comes to Penguicon...and brings friends next year]

<b>Female Matt:</b> There's this convention that I sometimes help with, Penguicon?  It's pretty cool.  Have you heard of "fandom"?  No?  Oh...uhm, well you kind of look like you might fit in...maybe?

[Person politely takes contact info; doesn't remember to email or call]

----------

<b>Matt:</b> I'm the President of the Logical Language Group. We constructed this fantastic language called Lojban -- think "Esperanto" or "Klingon", but so much cooler -- and our Michigan group is one of the largest gatherings of Lojbanists in the world. You should come have fun with us!

[Person like me starts coming to the Lojban meetings]

<b>Female Matt:</b> Well, I'm kind of involved in this made-up language group called Lojban. We're friendly...maybe would you like to come sometime?

[Person politely takes contact info; doesn't remember to email or call]

----------

<b>Matt:</b>  There's this great game called Kingsburg that I want you to play...right after I show you Carcasonne.  No, of course you don't have to know anything about board games -- I'll show you!  But first I have to introduce you to Dominion. And while we're at it, I've got a game that I made myself that I want you to help me play test...

[Person like me plays board games, and eventually likes some of them.  Person still grumbles about play testing, but enjoys a new experience. ;P]

<b>Female Matt:</b> Uhm, anyone want to play a game with me?  Whatever you like.  You're asking me what that is?  Oh, that's just an experiment.  I was just playing around to see if I could make a board game.  No big deal, really.  We can play it, or not...

[Female Matt sits by herself; eventually gets invited to a game of Munchkin, which she doesn't like, but tries to be a good sport and not say anything.  Her game sits untested]</blockquote>

In today's over-crowded attention market -- whether that be for jobs or leisure or simply where a person ought to volunteer their time, people choose what stands out.  Shirky touched on this indirectly -- clearly a person who is good *and* exaggerates will stick out above those who are only good at they do, but even raw talent has to have a way to get noticed and we need to start training women to be as willing as men to put themselves out there.

By the way, thank you, Matt, for the loan of your body....
