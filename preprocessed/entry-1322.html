It turns out they were mainly looking for a student at their own university. They were surprised to discover that I am not a student there, and impressed that someone thought to photograph their poster and email it to me.

They are not sure how to hire someone other than their own students, without violating union rules. They said the union would most likely restrict them to hiring me as a temp job for less than 120 days. Given that it is ten to twenty hours a week making ten dollars an hour, any longer than 120 days would have posed a problem anyway.

Unfortunately, I had to recover my entire hard drive yesterday and reinstall everything, so I was not able to get any of my current web projects working. I recently re-architected <a href="http://cis.hfcc.edu/~marnold3/">my midterm project</a> at a basic level and that broke everything. Not even my own homepage was working, because I'm in the middle of migrating to a new host and upgrading to a new version of Wordpress. Fortunately <a href="http://cis.hfcc.edu/~marnold3/tctk/tctk.php">this site</a> worked, so I was able to show them <em>something</em>.

Then they showed me a problem they were having and I explained what an iframe was and what was happening, so this convinced them I wasn't inflating my expertise.

We had a discussion about which departments would shackle my ability to do my job. That is two-fold. It will be tricky to get permission to access the server through anything but Dreamweaver, and the marketing department wants to make all the creative decisions. I'll see how much I can work around that, but if my workload every day consists of:

1. Send follow-up emails to unresponsive permission-granters.

2. Go home because there's nothing to do.

... then I don't see the job lasting very long.

Fortunately the ears of the interviewers perked up when I mentioned my print expertise in Adobe InDesign, and showed them samples of that. They may have some work for me in that area as well.</div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/338598.html">Original</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1322"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1321.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1323.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
