I want an environment in which they can be confident that they are meeting friends, not getting a lot of pressure or big expectations.

So you can predict my growing shock, alarm, disgust, and facepalm, at hearing about guys making unwanted advances, and even <em>sexual assault</em>, toward women at OSCON, OLS, or other open source related events. It's wrong to not take no for an answer. It's <em>unthinkable</em> to get all handsy, and I wouldn't tolerate it if I saw it happen. I would make sure they get kicked out. I keep worrying if it's happening at Penguicon and no one's reporting it.

For a geek event, Penguicon has an unusually large percentage of women attendees, organizers, and presenters (on all topics, not just tech). Our attendance has got to be somewhere between one third to one half women. They are just as passionate about the convention. If that went away, it would no longer be anything like the con we have come to know. The shocking behavior at other events related to open source is sparking an organized backlash which is long overdue. Unfortunately I think we're going to get lumped in. We already have a harassment policy, requiring that you leave people alone when they ask you to, forbidding touching without express permission, and promising the victims of abuse that the con will back them up. But I wouldn't mind expanding the policy.

The really cool Geek Feminism Wiki has a boilerplate <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Conference_anti-harassment_policy">Tech Conference Anti-Harassment Policy Document</a>. It's really good. I would only make three changes for our circumstances.

<lj-cut text="Switch 'safe feeling' to 'comfortable environment'.">As is all too common in the discussion of sensitivity, the boilerplate policy text escalates discomfort into a lack of safety; so I would switch "safe feeling" to "comfortable environment":<blockquote>"... to feel safe for the duration of the conference."</blockquote><blockquote>"... to restore a comfortable environment for the duration of the conference."</blockquote>It should be an environment which actually <em>is</em> comfortable in the judgement of 99% of the women at Penguicon, including those women running the con. We're not going to capitulate to the demands of those few attendees, both male and female, who we have to ban from the con, and have the hotel kick them out, and occasionally mock publicly, because everyone (including their own friends) agree they are insane liars.

Of course if you're actually in danger, you're also not comfortable, so this verbiage catches all the conditions meant by "safe".</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text="Remove the broad, nearly-meaningless 'offensive'.">Second, I would remove the broad, nearly meaningless "offensive" in this passage:<blockquote>"Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention."</blockquote>Where verbal comments are concerned, you can't control how everyone reacts to what you say. It is vitally important not to forbid topics that offend people; pretty much every important truth that matters is offensive to someone. <a href="http://live.gnome.org/CodeOfConduct/SpeakerGuidelines">The GNOME speaker guidelines</a> must be violated by every speaker, if there is to be any content worth listening to. Few things "offend" me more than the craven, phony, marketing-driven desire for the approval of <em>everyone</em>.

So far as I am aware from reading about incidents at conferences around the world, the rest of the sentence covers it fairly thoroughly:<blockquote>"Harassment includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention."</blockquote></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text="Modify the prohibition on sexual images.">We'd have to take out the prohibition on "sexual images in public spaces", but maybe we could modify it to be just about tech presentations.

Penguicon is not a workplace, a business, or one of those snooze-athons called tech conferences. If it were, most of us would stop attending. It's more like a hackerspace, LUG meeting, or <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.org/w/page/16345504/FrontPage">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>, combined with a science-fiction con, gaming con, and comedy music festival. It's a convention about all possible geeky interests, even if you happen to use your recreational interests in your career. I'm not sure how we can say "exhibitors should not use sexualized images" when sexualized images are their product. If we ask science fiction fans to not include Seven of Nine on the poster for their Star Trek themed room party, or wear a Princess Leia metal bikini to the masquerade, what would be the point of a convention to celebrate the science fiction we are fans of? The con would die.</lj-cut>

In addition to the recommendations for the policy, I have an open question and an impassioned plea:

<lj-cut text="An open question."><strong>Open question for you:</strong> given that Penguicon is one big party scene, with a before-party, a during-party, and an after-party, why don't we get reports of harassment, intimidation, stalking, following, inapropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention? Why does it happen at snooze-athons where attendees are expected to act "professional"?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text="An impassioned plea to men looking for a woman."><strong>I would also like to make an impassioned plea to guys who are specifically looking for a relationship with a woman.</strong> Perhaps you have reasoned (correctly) that it would be awesome to have a relationship with a woman who shares your interests and enjoys your social settings. Conventions should be a place where a woman can expect to make friends without pressure or expectations. But it is exactly that comfort level that can lead to mutual respect, and every once in a while, substantial relationships develop over long periods of time. Making passes at a woman you just met, during the con itself, does not serve anybody's goals, including yours.

No sooner had I attended my first Penguicon (the first one, in 2003) than I developed a huge crush on someone. I waited three years before I ever told her, and then we dated. I met someone at Penguicon 2006, and we were friends for two years before I politely told her how fascinating and lovely she is, and how high I hold her in my esteem, and how I think about her when she's not around. We dated for years. I met someone at Penguicon 2009. She's really cool and fun. Didn't tell her so until a year had passed. Told her. Dated. You see the pattern. The whole scenario has been fortunate beyond measure.

That's not always the outcome. Occasionally nothing changes. They understand it doesn't come with expectations or pressure that anything should happen, and that what matters is continued friendship. So again, it was full of "win". It's no problem because we are friends with trust and understanding. That will not develop over the course of one party.

(With some of them, I decide to <em>never</em> say anything for various reasons, because for crying out loud, it's not all about me.)

So basically, if you act entitled, get pushy, make it all about you, take only a superficial interest, or don't bother to get to know her first, you are not only ruining her day. You are not only reducing your game store or con or outing or hackerspace or LARPing group or comics shop or chat room. You are also defeating yourself.</lj-cut></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"><div class="tag"><span class="tag-text">Tags: </span><ul><li><a href="../index.html#culture" rel="tag">culture</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#relationships" rel="tag">relationships</a>, </li><li><a href="../index.html#the sexes" rel="tag">the sexes</a></li></ul></div><ul class="entry-interaction-links text-links"><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="https://nemorathwald.dreamwidth.org/343337.html">Original</a></li><li class="entry-permalink first-item"><a href="../entries/entry-1341.html">11 comments</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div><div id="comments-wrapper-1341"><div class="inner"><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt6340" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt6340"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Dec. 4, 2010 3:28 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_46539" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_46539</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-6340-insertion-point">How would you apply it to ConFusion?

Women aren't some rare creature at which to gawk, nor are they isolated. The sheer number of women in corsets or short skirts or garb makes it clear that they are doing it for themselves and not as some bid for male companionship. And the couple of times I've seen some guy try to make an unwelcome invasion into a woman's personal space, people have stepped into the conversation before it got to the point of harassment. So I think women at penguicon feel empowered and comfortable. 

That's not to say we should ever feel smug or think we are insulated from the possibility. But I do think we start from a position of relative strength.  </div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="2" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-2 comment-depth-2" style="--comment-depth: 2;"><div id="cmt6350" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt6350"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Dec. 6, 2010 2:36 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_54813" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_54813</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-6350-insertion-point">I'm gonna second Zoethe here.

From what you have written (I have no knowledge of what else may be covered in the policy) I find I disagree with removing either statement.

"Harassment includes offensive verbal comments,..." Offensive, while it may seem vague to you, is what would be offensive to a reasonable woman. I do mean to state "woman" as I am speaking from that view point. Accordingly, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 1964 clarifies with,"Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general." As a woman of many (MANY) years of life, who is  surrounded by mostly women, I know that women perceive harassment differently than most males perceive harassment. It has less to do with being in-tuned to the feminine side of yourself and more to do with living in a world where we women are at risk of being verbally accosted and of physical sexual harm. It comes in forms as simple as the on-going "What? All I said was she has incredible boobs! Am I lying?" Sounds ridiculous, to a reasonable person, but I have lost count of the number of times statements such as these have been made in front of me. Often times by males I thought "got it." Leave "offensive verbal comments" in place. You are correct, "you can't control how everyone reacts to what you say", but to remove it opens the door to some jerk just being themselves without the need to consider around them.  I don't see how prohibiting offensive verbal comments forbids topics? Aren't topics something one attends by choice?

I also think you miss the intent by changing "... to feel safe for the duration of the conference." to "... to restore a comfortable environment for the duration of the conference." Feeling safe and feeling comfortable are entirely different concepts. I feel comfortable knowing there are friends nearby; however, I feel unsafe when they are distance away from me. If I am attending a conference where I have had verbal harassment from someone, and I continue to see that someone from time to time, even when I am with a group of friends, in the back of mind lurks a feeling of being unsafe.  Also (because with me there is ALWAYS more) when we hear the words safe and comfortable, they conjure different images. For most people, the primary meaning of safe is to to be free from harm and danger; while the primary meaning of comfortable is more about a physical sensation.

I applaud your outlook and passion on keeping people safe AND comfortable while they are enjoying the various CONS.

The policy bans "unwelcome sexual attention". Do you agree this would include complementing a stranger on her breasts?

In both cases, the wrong policy implies "the customer is always right". We know from years of experience that only most of them are right.

We had a guy who wanted quiet, but reserved a room on the official party floor despite repeated warnings and offers to help get a room on the official quiet floor. He complained, and even called the cops on the room parties and attempted to get them all shut down. It went to the point that the hotel, with the help of the police, had to kick him out. He was not in an unsafe or uncomfortable environment, but he told us he <em>felt</em> unsafe and uncomfortable. He was a raving lunatic with a massive sense of personal entitlement. I don't want an unstable fruitcake like him to be able to wave in our face a policy guaranteeing <em>his feelings</em>.

I want to protect the ability of participants in a panel discussion, not just to have this or that panel topic, but to take controversial and upsetting opinions on the topic at hand. For instance, I think the world's religious heritages are misanthropic and abusive. That sure as hell "offends" me. In return, religious people get upset about my objection to their teachings, by framing the discussion as being about their identity group instead! That's why I omitted the part with the brackets, where specific concerns are listed, including religion. There's no way I want a convention to have an official policy picking a winner-- neither would I want the organizers saying it's off limits in a panel discussion about religion or mythology in science fiction.

Rude and unsafe are not the same thing. Women at Penguicon are not rare, they are not isolated, and they are not alone. We must respond proportionally to the severity of the offense-- following, and touching, currently carry an official consequence of getting kicked out. But hurting someone's <i>feelings</i> will carry a social consequence. This is a pretty tight-knit community, and we know who complemented their friend on her breasts when it was unwelcome. Or, I should say, ex-friend.</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="3" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-3 comment-depth-3" style="--comment-depth: 3;"><div id="cmt6345" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 50px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt6345"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Dec. 4, 2010 11:00 PM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_338581" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_338581</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-6345-insertion-point">I agree with Matt here.

That's really the solution to keeping your daughter safe: teach her to fight back. </div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-comment-depth="1" class="comment-thread comment-depth-indent-desktop comment-depth-indent-mobile comment-depth-odd comment-depth-mod5-1 comment-depth-1" style="--comment-depth: 1;"><div id="cmt6347" class="dwexpcomment" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 5px;"><div class="comment-wrapper comment-wrapper-odd visible full has-userpic no-subject"><div class="separator separator-before"><div class="inner"></div></div><div class="comment" id="comment-cmt6347"><div class="inner"><div class="header"><div class="inner"><h4 class="comment-title"></h4><span class="datetime"><span class="comment-date-text">Date: </span><span>Dec. 5, 2010 2:09 AM</span></span></div></div><div class="contents"><div class="inner"><div class="userpic"></div><span class="poster comment-poster"><span class="comment-from-text">From: </span><span class="ljuser" style="white-space: nowrap;"><img src="../user.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;" alt="[personal profile]"><a href="https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_100082" style="font-weight:bold;">ext_100082</a></span></span><div class="comment-content" id="comment-content-6347-insertion-point">Regarding what is 'offensive' - everyone has a different threshold. Really. There is no place where *someone* won't be offended, either by too much or too little of any given thing. 

Speaking as someone who inexplicably still qualifies as a Cute Girl, it can get really tedious to dodge the comments 24/7 - especially since 3/4 of the comments come with an implied putdown included. Can you say "leveling"? Yeah - the guys know they have no chance going in, so they throw out double entendres, designed to compliment and insult at the same time. 

My personal take is that if I'm out in full con garb, I'm expecting people to *look*. I'm not expecting them to *touch*. I am expecting the sort of conversation that some folks would consider to be 'harrassment' and which I consider 'banter.' If If someone doesn't want to play that game, they should consider wearing different costuming. 

There is no safe garb, either. There are folks out there who are turned on by burkhas, and nun-wear, and three-piece suits, and think that bikinis are boring because they reveal too much.

Women will be hired to dress in skimpy clothing as part of the advertising. The waitstaff will be women in too-tight skirts and low-cut blouses. This is designed to turn off the logic centers of the male brain and get them to make purchasing decisions with their 'other head'. The typical male, bombarded with this sort of stimulation, has trouble differentiating between the female colleague and the female advertising drone. And so mistakes occur. Add in that a given woman might be reluctant to rip the balls off her boss's boss, even when he's got his hand up her skirt, and the situation gets worse. 

It comes down to culture. At an SF con, the general membership will likely back up the woman in such a confrontation, and in a work con the general membership would likely back up the man. You need to change the attitude that women are there only as advertising, or as assistants to men. Good luck with that...</div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div><div class="separator separator-after"><div class="inner"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navigation bottomnav"><div class="inner"><ul><li class="page-back"><a href="entry-1340.html">Previous Entry</a></li><li class="page-separator"> | </li><li class="page-forward"><a href="entry-1342.html">Next Entry</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
