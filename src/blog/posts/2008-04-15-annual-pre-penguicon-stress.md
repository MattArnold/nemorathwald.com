Hello, my old acquaintance. You're late this year! You usually arrive in March and don't leave until the program book has gone to the printer. Arriving after it has gone to the printer is a new trick. But you need new tricks, don't you? I'm gaining mastery. Well, I'm banishing you now. Arrivaderci, Annual Pre-Penguicon Stress.

I do have in my arsenal... tools that will completely obliterate pre-con/at-con stress.

If it ends with the word "torpedo", even the SMELL banishes stress! :P

I will indeed have the fixins for the torpedo with me this weekend. While I can't promise a show as good as Thesser... the end results should be the same
