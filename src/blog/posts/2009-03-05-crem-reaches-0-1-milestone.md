![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/SbAtf5weWUI/AAAAAAAAGT4/7sE-L0jnxOE/s800/crem01.png) [CREM](http://penguicon.net/projects/crem) is now on version 0.1, and is a well-documented project. Ever since I got free PyCon staff memberships for Bruce and , for them to videotape the sessions with me, they have been stoked about getting this presentable in time. Their plan is to bring CREM flyers and have a demo up on the web to show those who they meet at PyCon. Currently CREM has the database model complete, and set up with the first draft of a masthead and navigation template. It has the ability to create pages very simply, by embedding little snippets of webpages called partials. Each partial corresponds to a particular database entry type (presenters, rooms, and so forth), and will offer either an editing field or a display of that type of entry. So, by stringing together partials, we can quickly create (let's say for instance) a homepage intended for such-and-such a person, with all of the new things relevant to them flagged for their attention, and the things they think they are most likely to need at their fingertips. It can be conditional. For instance, if you just did "this", now it shows you "that". If you are such-and-such a user, you see or edit certain things based on your access. Now that this system of partials is in place, versions 0.2 through 1.0 will go quickly.
