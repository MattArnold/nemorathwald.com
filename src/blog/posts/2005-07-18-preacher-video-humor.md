_"Televangelist Benny Hinn is threatening to sue the religious satire magazine The Door for [the video clip it is distributing that shows Hinn's wife](http://www.beliefnet.com/story/3/story_317_1.html), Suzanne, preaching at their former church in Orlando, Florida. She says if you're a lifeless, blackslidden Christian, you need a "Holy Ghost enema... right up your rear end."_ Because, according to Mz. Hinn, "God won't tolerate" you not getting a Holy Ghost enema. She paces back and forth on the stage like a drunken caged tiger, raves against "butt-kissers," loses her shoes and goes on some obscure tangent about high-heels, blames her sense of humor on being British, and collapses on the stage at the end of her lunatic breakdown, which is typical of "spirit-filled" services. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's just difficult to take as seriously as the crowd obviously wants to take it. I laughed so hard I nearly fell down, so perhaps that means I'm filled with the spirit! If anyone is filled with the spirit, it's Robert Tilton, isn't it? And in [this hilarious video, the spirit just won't stop coming out of him.](http://www.big-boys.com/articles/fartingpreacher.html) I got that from PCCboard. Some of my favorite comments there were, "The man is full of prophetic utterances," and "It's like a mightly rushing wind!"

The mention of Benny Hinn sends me into convulsions of rage. He is a sociopath who preys on the sick at their most desperate hour. He fills their heads with lies, takes their money, and leaves them for dead. Many of them end up foregoing medical treatment, believing themselves "cured". When his victims die, their families blame themselves because they did not give Hinn _enough_ money. I have an mp3 interview with a couple of medical students who went behind the scenes at a Hinn "healing" crusade. Got it at infidelguy.com a few years back (great program). The interview is sad, shocking and infuriating. I'll send it to you if you like.

Please do send it. As if I need to be provoked into more rage at faith healers than I already express on a regular basis...

I particularly enjoyed the spiking motion of her thumb, as she was talking about the enema. And the jiggley bit at the end where she's going "RIDE!!!! RIDE!!! RIDE!!!!" like she's a deranged Lance Armstrong kills me. And finally, is it me, or does she not have an English accent?
