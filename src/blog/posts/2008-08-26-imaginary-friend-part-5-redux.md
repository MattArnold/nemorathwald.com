I've been thinking, "What does my webcomic need?" 1. Less monologue, more dialogue 2. Response to the phone with "hello, God?" which it was really foreshadowing anyway 3. More fun to draw So here is page five again, except totally different, picking up from here: ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000caap5) ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cb859)
