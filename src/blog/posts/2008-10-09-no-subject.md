I've heard that in order to be a good radio DJ you have to select music that isn't what they're already hearing on mainstream radio, but also music that's really high-quality. If you run a clothing boutique you have to give them clothing that they'll love but which is not on the shelves at Walmart. You give people things that maybe they didn't know they were going to love. [PodDisc](http://poddisc.com) is like that. I'm launching the Drabblecast on the store in a few days, and I am really proud of this. My favorite podcasts are always high-quality but are not the massive ones owned by big media. Don't get me wrong, if big media decided to sell on the site, I wouldn't turn them down, but this is a boutique shop and I'm starting with indie gems. My latest idea is to create a 60-second audio track of really good snippets that characterize all the shows, and put that on the homepage.
