Thanks to  , I got a $1,500 tax refund, when I had previously thought I owed money I couldn't pay. This is the kind of wizardry she has the ability and desire to perform. I don't know where I'd be without her.

Glad you got yourself a professional. :)

Actually, I'm not a professional -- I'm just a friend who helped Matt for free because I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't mind reading the tax documents and crunching the numbers. And no, I'm not someone who does consulting for friends on a regular basis. Matt just gets a special benefit because of who he is... :)

Thanks for the compliment, but it wasn't wizardry. Most of the tax return was pretty straight-forward, and the part that I wasn't familiar with was just a matter of online reading. Actually, I lost you some money by doing your taxes correctly, so don't thank me too much. ;P But I'm glad you're happy enough with the results to post to your LJ about it.

In the end, accuracy is more important in the long run. Trust me, you don't want to be on the government's radar. ;)
