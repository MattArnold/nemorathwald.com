A fan scanned and posted [a story from the great science fiction comic book Transmetropolitan](http://community.livejournal.com/fullscans_daily/11529.html) and instead of issuing a cease-and-desist, Warren Ellis linked to it and told everybody to go read it. "Another Cold Morning" is a story about cryonics that was told with unusual warmth and sensitivity for this series. The author's sociological critiques would ordinarily be delivered with a sledgehammer of hilariously irreverent wit. But for all its compassion and humanity, it's still not worksafe. Not even a little bit. There is no such thing as an issue of Transmetropolitan that would be suitable for the faint of heart, the prude, or the easily future-shocked. Read it and find out why it is my favorite thing in comics. I'm now going to get some of the trade paperbacks down off the shelf and re-read them for what must be the hundredth time.

I have to move my comics soon, to leave room for the young woman you looked over when I came to MOFO a few months back LOL-Linda moves in June 3. I might have to look over some of my fave issues to get that feelign back of when I first read them. Granted, nothing such as your book graces my boxes, but my autographed New Titans #50 (signed by George Perez and Marv Wolfman) is my baby. If I had waldoes, I'd be reading that one using those LOL. Last weekend, I had to explain the difference to my 12 year old daughter, Shelly, between trade paperbacks, graphic novels, and manga. Got a bit misty-eyed doing that, only thing I got as far as tradition to give her.

I <3 Transmet. However I hate comics - the format. Little flimsy books. I download (piracy, I totally admit.) but I would pay if I could get a copy online. TPBs aren't much better, either.

Very nice. The art reminds me of John Byrne's "Next Men" series.
