By all means, post about what interests you. However, in the name of not taking up \*all\* of my Friends page, would you please consider using lj-cut for some of your longer rants? Thanks!

[I Now Pronounce You Liable for Damages](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/74438.html) was about 725 words. [Mezzo Desktop Environment](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/76592.html) was about 625 words. [Discrimination Against Universists](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/75460.html) was about 525 words. Do one of these fall within the acceptable range of a post that doesn't need an LJ cut?

In my opinion, yes. More importantly, they are all posts on issues that are more likely to interest a broad spectrum of your readers.

If those don't need an lj-cut, I still need more information. The only entries I'm able to find that exceed the length of the ones I listed are the Beginner's Guide to Space Chess. [Part 5](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/67939.html?mode=reply) was 837 words. [Part 2](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/66997.html) was 892 words. [Part 4](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/67770.html) was 963 words. Where is the word-limit threshold that requires an LJ-cut?

I think all three of these are a bit too long to go without a cut, and Part 2 in particular has illustrations which eat screen real estate big time. Off-hand, I'd suggest an lj-cut for a post over about 650 words. or slightly shorter posts with lots of illustrations. One of my friends uses lj-cut just for illustrations, if those are particularly large and the text is not, and the illustrations can be viewed after the text is read without significant loss of context.
