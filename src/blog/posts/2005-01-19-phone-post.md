Go christmas-tree shopping! That's what I did. Or just shopping in general, anything that uses your distance sight... (Of course, by the time you can read this again it will be completely irrelevent. Oh well.)

Since my housemate has a large wide-screen TV, I played _Metroid Prime_ and could see it fine from across the room. One of the things that's different about contact lenses today from the last time I wore them, which was all during my teens, is that they're much less picky about sanitation. When I was 12 and got my first pair, the doctors stressed to me almost to the level of paranoia that before touching my contact lenses I must thoroughly sanitize my hands and not touch anything else. "You will get germs and your contacts will make you go blind forever," they warned. Today the doctor saw me shaking water off my hands in preparation for inserting my new lenses, and shocked me by giving me a paper towel. I guess now that they're disposable there's no longer enough time to accumulate dangerous germ cultures.

At least it wasn't too sunny out. Last time I got my eyes dialted I damn near fell down from the bright sun when I went outside. I had to go home that day too, I couldn't see the screen. I have never phone posted, but now I think I might try it. How exciting! :)
