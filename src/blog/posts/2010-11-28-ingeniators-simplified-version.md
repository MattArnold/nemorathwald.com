This is the super-simplified version of Ingeniators, in response to the feedback from the game design contest. It could be sold separately or in the same box with the advanced version. **Equipment:**

*   1 game board: ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHkVPhfUcI/AAAAAAAAIMY/Zuj5ZaPIpXc/s400/simplified-Ingeniators-board.jpg)
*   9 types of triangle tiles, 10 each: ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHulqpKSpI/AAAAAAAAINY/_psveNJDgTQ/s288/9tiles.jpg)
*   lots of 4-sided color dice: ![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHoM3kaI2I/AAAAAAAAINA/LzjTOJ9Yvzk/s144/4sidedcolordice.jpg)
*   4 of these valve markers: ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHxdshpUCI/AAAAAAAAINg/o6ncnRddFg4/s800/valvemarkers.jpg)

**Game Setup:** Place the board in the center of the table. Give each player 3 dice. Each player gets a valve marker, chooses a corner of the board, and puts their valve on one of the colors shown on that corner (red, yellow, or blue). Sort the triangle tiles and stack them by type. This is called the supply. Choose a starting player randomly. **Turn Sequence:**

1.  **Roll your dice and resolve green dice.** Throughout the game you will get more dice, but at the beginning you only have 3. If you need more than are included with the game, other players must loan them to you until the end of your turn. Each die has a red side, a blue side, a yellow side, and a green side. As an example, this is what it looks like for one of these color dice to come up yellow: ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHydMun44I/AAAAAAAAINo/RdcI0nNuDPo/s800/yellowdie.jpg) Each die has a green side to represent your valve. Change any dice which come up green, to whichever color your valve is on. Once per turn, you may use a full triplet of red-yellow-blue to set your own valve or someone's valve to a different color. Then re-roll those three dice.  
2.  **Produce tiles with your dice.** Three dice produce one tile. Six dice produce two tiles, nine dice produce three tiles, and so on. You may mix and match your rolled dice into any combinations of three that you want. There are three types of tile edges: red Belts, blue Gears, and yellow Boilers. A red die represents a Belt, a blue die represents a Gear, and a yellow die represents a Boiler. Each edge of a triangle tile will be one of these three. So if you roll a red and two yellows, you may take a tile with a red side and two yellow sides. Every dice combination you could come up with will correspond to exactly one type of tile, except for a set of red-yellow-blue. The game does not include tiles with that combination of edges. That is why, once per turn, a red-yellow-blue combo lets you change a valve on the board and gets re-rolled. Put the tile(s) you have made in front of you.  
3.  **Install tiles.** To install tiles is to put them in triangular spots on the Board. At all times, when two tiles on the board touch on the edges, the touching edges must be identical. Belts must match to belts. Boilers must match to boilers. Gears must match to gears. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHp7tfpAfI/AAAAAAAAINM/jxv0DIh9TEQ/s288/TileMatchingCorrect.png)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPHp8PmknRI/AAAAAAAAINQ/jf2Ln9vjexs/s288/TileMatchingIncorrect.png) The board has two sections of 24 spaces each. The one with a paper texture and blue tint is the Blueprint, and the one with the rust texture and brass tint is the Workshop. You may only install a tile in the Workshop side of the board, if the same space on the Blueprint side of the board is filled with the same tile in the same rotation. For instance, if space "h" on the Blueprint board is filled with a tile, you may install the same tile in the same rotation in space "h" of the Workshop board. Every time you install a tile on the Workshop board, you gain a new die, which you roll at the start of every turn for the rest of the game. You may hold one tile in your hand for a future turn if you wish. You may not have more than one tile in hand between turns. Your hand is public, so you may not conceal the tile.

**Game end and scoring:** The game ends at the end of the turn when the last space on the Blueprint side of the board is filled with a tile. Whoever has the most dice wins.

I'll need a couple dozen of [these](http://www.amazon.com/4-sided-Blank-Color-looks-round/dp/B0018TKHXC), and won't be able to afford it for a month or two, but then OK!
