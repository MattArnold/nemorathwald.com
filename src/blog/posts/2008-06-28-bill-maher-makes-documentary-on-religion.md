Look, I'm sorry if this clip makes you feel bad about yourself, because that's not the point. It's the world we live in. If the shoe fits, wear it, and make your religious expression more sophisticated. If the shoe doesn't fit, I'm not intending to make it fit you. Not everything is about you.

I neither need nor want a political movement to justify my own faith and beliefs. I don't want or want you approval, either. Nor do I need to prove the validity of my beliefs in a scientific sense to feel comfortable. What is True is true. You know what pisses me off on both "sides?" The idea that I either have to buy your orthodoxy hook, line and sinker or be on my own. Well, I'm secure enough to be on my own out here, in the isthmus between believer othodoxy and athiestic orthodoxy alike. Come join me, if ya'll have the the balls. Out here, it takes courage.

"Not everything is about you." Hah - shows what you know about \*MY\* religion. ;-) I wrote that as a retort, but actually, it's very true. I would say that for most people, their religion IS all about them. They have a "personal relationship with ghod" which translates to "I think ghod likes me better than he likes you." Oddly, they ALL believe this. Go figure. Me, I have my doubts. If there is a god, he's a lot more like the Trickster gods of Native American tradition than anything the Judeo-Christian mythos, or even the Egyptians or Greeks, have in their pantheon. The movie should be interesting. I predict that every religion complains about it.

Well I'll be damned... Bill Maher finally turned out something that might be worth watching. Thanks for the link. That guy who says, "You start disputing my God and you got a problem" reminds me of many people I've met over the years who are so insecure in their religion that any question of their faith is met with outright hostility.
