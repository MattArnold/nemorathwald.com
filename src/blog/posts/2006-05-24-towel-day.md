Tomorrow, May 25, 2006, carry a towel with you all day to commemorate [Towel Day](http://www.towelday.kojv.net/), a day of remembrance for Douglas Adams.

I love Douglas Adams, but I don't know if I can do this at my current job. Maybe I'll camouflage it in a paper bag or something, but I'll still look funny carrying that bag around with me all day....

If I am without my towel I will at least be sure to wear, and be preoccupied with, my digital watch. What a pretty neat idea!

It's already packed in my messenger bag to take with me tomorrow. \*grin\*

I plan on being froody, and knowing where my towel is. :)

I can tuck it in my belt, hang it from my waist and use it to wipe my hands. I work in a warehouse, and I get dirt on my hands constantly. I just have to watch to not get it stuck in the conveyor.....

Argh. I completely missed it. But at least I knew where my towel was, so it's not all bad.
