I drilled down all the way to Washington, DC and saw two tourists with beanie propeller hats walking by the White House! Then I drilled down to where my townhouse should be (it just shows a lot of green).

Yeah, I remember playing Dragon Quest/Warrior so long ago and when I saw that, I had laughed hard. I especially like the video that went with it (to fix bugs, blow in the cartridge. Quite hilarious :) ).

The street view in particular amuses me.
