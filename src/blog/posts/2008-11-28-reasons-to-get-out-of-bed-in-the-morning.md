Sometimes when I wake up and open my eyes, I think of the phrase "having a reason to get out of bed in the morning." Then I think "according to that phrase, apparently I need a reason!" All this time, I've been doing it wrong. Pretty soon I made a habit of naming a reason every time. It's just this thing I do-- I figure as long as I have a high natural set-point for happiness in my brain chemistry, that makes this an easier task for me than for most people, I may as well take advantage of it. The first time it was, "because I have a bed, and its mattress and blankets are great." The next time it was "because of whose bed this is." The third time it was "because I don't have to get out of bed today." Most of the people on my friends list have been the reason at least once. Happy Thanksgiving.

Hmm, I often find that a nice mattress, comfy blankets, etc. is a reason to want to hit the snooze alarm, not a reason to get out of bed. :) Ah, the joys of being a night owl...
