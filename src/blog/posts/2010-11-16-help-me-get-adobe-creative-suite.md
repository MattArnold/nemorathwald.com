Now that I'm a student, I only have to pay 25% or less for Adobe software. Creative Suite is a bundle of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I use those three for science fiction convention books, board games, business cards, webcomics, website graphics, and the occasional professional contract. Acrobat Pro is the application that generates PDFs from these source files and lets me adjust a lot of page imposition and settings for print shops. Flash creates animated clips like [the one I made a few months ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6xTujaVkzQ). Dreamweaver edits websites. It's better to just use a text editor, but my current job requires Dreamweaver. The time has come to start on the program book for ConFusion, and since I don't have the software, I have to catch the ever-changing open hours in the computer lab at school. If you like having your convention books look good, or if you like my board games, webcomics, and website graphics, would you chip in? How much money I raise will determine which package I get: Creative Suite Design Standard: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat Pro. Student price: $300. Creative Suite Design Premium: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat Pro, Flash, Dreamweaver. Student price: $450.

Does the student license only work while you're a student? AASFA has money, don't they? Maybe it's high time the convention bought a set of install disks for the software that's needed to prepare their pubs.

No, the license would continue to work. That's a brilliant idea. I will propose it to them.
