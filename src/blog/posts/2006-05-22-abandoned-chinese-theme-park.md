A large crucifix stands in an abandoned Chinese theme park. In [a photographic tour of the park](http://www.jlasso.com/disgraceland/9.html), M. Otis Beard has this to say about it:

* * *

![](http://www.jlasso.com/disgraceland/jeez.jpg)_Did you hear about this case? This guy was born out of wedlock, see, and his biological dad was some kind of lunatic cult leader who years before had ordered his followers to slaughter all their neighbors, right down to the babies in their cribs. The poor kid would never admit or deny that this insaniac was his dad, but his friends all knew it was true, and they thought it was pretty cool. One day when the illegitimate son was in his early 30s, the loony dad suddenly started taking an interest in him, but not in a good way... he had the poor kid tortured and killed just to satisfy his weird insatiable bloodlust. After the murder he started pretending to be nice to people and made a habit of inviting his dead son's friends over for dinner every Sunday. He'd feed them meat from his own son's corpse and fill their wineglasses with the kid's blood! The police still haven't caught up with him, and it's been years and years now. Brrrr, gives me the shivers!_

Have you looked on snopes for this?

Just for kicks, I typed "Jesus" into the Snopes search engine. It returned 101 results that include the word "Jesus", but none of these urban legends are the gospel message itself. If you're implying that the stories of Jesus of Nazareth are urban legends, I would agree they are most successful urban legends of all time. And it is also the form of urban legend which Snopes refers to as "glurge". But I don't think Snopes considers debunking the world's major religions to be within its purview.

Do you write your own HTML in posts? Here's a tag I think you'll appreciate, being quite fluent in layout... <img hspace="5" vspace="5" src="Wherever your pic comes from"> It's just the regular image tag, but including vspace and hspace (vertical and horizontal) will insert that many pixels of blank space immediately around an object, so that text will not be **immediately** next to your image.
