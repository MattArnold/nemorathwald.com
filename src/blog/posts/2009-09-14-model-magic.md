I tried Model Magic. "7X Easier to Use than Clay" is not true. You can sculpt clay or plasticine. All you can do with Model Magic is wad it up. It reminds me of shaping wadded-up aluminum foil or plastic wrap. It's springy, and wants to keep its shape. The seams won't smooth over, so it clearly looks like lumps that have been smashed together. When you try to remove some, the rest of it clings in long stretchy strands that deform the model. Uncured MM cuts with scissors, but it was difficult to avoid cutting the strings in the puppet's abdomen. Perhaps I've been spoiled by a lifetime of sculpting plasticine, and need to learn new techniques? I'll wait until it dries and try sanding or carving it. If that works well, it will probably turn out all right after all.

I have some other ideas for modeling for you. There is "paper clay" that you can use to smooth over a paper mache'. Both are light, but for sure a different feel than that of plasticine. We should talk soon.

I've used paperclay. The brand I used was good to work with, but was brittle and broke without much handling over the decade that followed. I'm open to it, but am concerned that a coating of it might flake off since puppets move and touch things so much. Today I picked up an 8.82oz pack of Fimo Air Microwave. It's not actually Fimo at all-- it's very light weight. I have no idea how workable it is. Fortunately it comes in terra-cotta color, the same as the Model Magic. Almost all the terra-cotta MM got used up on this: ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sq7cASlsMrI/AAAAAAAAHJA/hV-vRZhWibc/s800/marionette_model_magic1.jpg)![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sq7cAo_IbII/AAAAAAAAHJE/kvCcDhFe9ks/s800/marionette_model_magic2.jpg) Soon we will need costume patterns for baggy pants and baggy sleeves. The curled collar might be a challenge, but maybe it should have wire in it. The cummerbund and cape should be no problem without a pattern. ![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/SMAyk8fTUZI/AAAAAAAADkM/JthKly-bt_w/s288/Grand-Vizier-Kulat.gif)

"7X easier to use than the worst clay we could find in our backyard"?
