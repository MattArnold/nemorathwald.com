Hey everybody, it's great to hear from you, but between 4 and 6 PM on Monday and Wednesday I am in Java class. I'll call you back in ten minutes! Thanks!

Can't you turn off your phone or your ringer during that time?

I set it to send calls directly to voice mail during that time. The problem is, I don't pick up, so they don't get to talk to me.

It wasn't That Important, as the situation is taken care of. Just left the voice mail so you didn't need to call me later. \*hugs\*
