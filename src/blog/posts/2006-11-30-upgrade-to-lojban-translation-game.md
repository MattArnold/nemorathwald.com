[![](http://www.teddyb.org/jsk/jsk.png)](http://www.teddyb.org/jsk/) After months of work, Timo Paulsen has finished applying my new graphic design and user interface upgrades to the code of [jboselkei, the Lojban Translation Game](http://www.teddyb.org/jsk/), and Robin Lee Powell has installed the upgrade on the web. There are some new features, like the ability to click a link under Lojban text you are composing, to submit it to the online parser to be validated. Check it out!
