A meme lifted from . If you read this, please post a poem in your livejournal. **It Wears You** by Ann K. Schwader [from the free e-book of Strange Horizons August 2002](http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook7706.htm) _(to a wireless wearable computerite)_ Born swimmer in the data stream, you wear as effortlessly as a trout its gills this latest means of never needing air. No doubt the cyborg lifestyle has its thrills: your spectacles with that eyecorner screen keep you so well informed it's near obscene to plebians without. I must confess, however, to a sudden Luddite chill when contemplating your connectedness: which part is host, and which the parasite? By now, I fear, the two are so enmeshed that neither exorcism nor the knife could liberate such long-neglected flesh. Copyright (C) 2002 Ann K. Schwader And while we're on the subject of memes, here's a bonus poem. It was written by a memetics enthusiast in Scandinavia whose website I can no longer seem to find on the internet these days, and I can't remember his name. **Memetics** Down in the valley in the jungle Where all the fights have been fought There is a strange thing happening A species about to be brought To light Deep in the jungle moisture Where all the lessons have been taught There is a wild thing happening Witness this with mind and not With sight The most beautiful of couplings Ideas which can't be bought Climaxing and colliding There were Faith and Antithought That's right The species they are conceiving Mixes the known and the unknown Into a cauldron that's seething Static in the brain zone Good night
