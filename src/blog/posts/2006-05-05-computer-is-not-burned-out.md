Good news! The smoke and the "pop-hiss" didn't come from the computer, it came from the monitor! The computer's fine. I have _no_ shortage of monitors. None. In fact, a dozen monitors were deliberately abandoned at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/). If you're coming to [the Stilyagi party](http://www.stilyagi.org/) at our house on Saturday the 13th, maybe I'll give you one. Especially if we can sign you up to be on the convention committee for [ConFusion 2007](http://www.stilyagi.org/cons/2007/)!

Dude, my social calendar is filling up! I might snag one, the big ass monitor for old Betsy has this annoying habit of warping hideously.

I've got a story about a burnt out computer of mine... It's a Tyan MB with dual AMB 2200, 1 GB of Ram, and a 450 Watt PS. One day I get home from fixing other people's computers to find out that it off and won't reboot. I go to unplug the power supply to throw it into another machine to see if that's the problem and find out that the connectors are melted together. Long story short, it's dead, but I keep it around anyways... About 6 months later I'm browsing some forum and come across a post talking about a Tyan MB series that has problems with meltdowns. It turns out to be the exact motherboard I have sitting in the closet. Investigating further, I find that it has to do with the processers pulling too many amps (about 36A when running full throttle and the max is about 30A for all four red +5V lines) and causing the connectors to overheat and fuse together. Futhermore, there are success stories about people recovering their MBs! After hours of unsoldering the broken connectors and taking a good connector off of a junk MB and putting it in its place I was able to get my fastest PC up and running again. In order to prevent this from happening again, I took a spare molex connector and soldered its wires to the underside of the ATX connector to give it an extra +5V line. It's been running great ever since.

Glad to hear your computer is on the mend. I can scrounge up more monitors; if you find anyone who needs one send 'em our way. ;) --Bill
