I want to always remember Kevin Kelly's [Eight Generatives Better Than Free](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/01/better_than_fre.php). When your product can be copied a million times with the press of a button, these are things you make money from. I renamed them in order to make a mnemonic anagram. Mnemonics work better if there is something slightly odd or arbitrary about them, because that attracts attention. So "friend" is misspelled. If I make something that can be digitized, I need a **SHARP FREND**. **S**upport / **H**elp  "The software is free, but the documentation is $10,000." **A**ccess "Get your content in the format you need, on the device you want, anywhere you are." **R**eal "Trust that this is not a fake file substituting a virus, like you might get from file sharing." **P**ersonal "Get a backstage conversation with the artist, and/or your custom version of the product."

**F**ind / **R**ecommendations "The reason publishers, studios, labels, and other aggregators will never disappear." **E**mbodied "Get podcast archives on a beautiful CD as a gift or collector's item." **N**ow "Don't wait for when it shows up on file sharing, a long download, one missing block from a logged-out peer." **D**onations "Give because you love it and want the artist to continue."
