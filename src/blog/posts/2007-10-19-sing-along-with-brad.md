The motto of [Brad Sucks](http://bradsucks.net/) is "a one man band with no fans". Rest assured this name and motto is the ultimate in modesty. I have blogged before about the subtly funny "[Overreacting](http://www.bradsucks.net/music/albums/idkwid-128/09_-_Brad_Sucks_-_Overreacting.mp3)". To follow up his debut Creative Commons licensed album (the equally wrongly named "I Don't Know What I'm Doing"), [Brad is inviting the entire internet to provide background vocals for his next Creative-Commons-licensed song, "Out Of It".](http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/2007/09/27/out-of-it-community-backup-vocals/) Brad is fun. Everybody's getting in on this action. None other than internet music self-marketing genius and troubador extraordinaire [JoCo](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) has provided an accompaniment. I even think I recognize the host of Balticon's podcast in there. Join in! If you need audio help let me know. The deadline is Sunday, November 11. I've just finished mine and sent it in. How often are you going to hear me imitate The Soggy Bottom Boys from _Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?_ Not very often, I'll tell you!

Can we do a recording at the meeting on Saturday?

Sadly, there would not be enough sets of headphones to keep everyone timed right and keep the guitar and Brad himself off the recording.
