As usual, postmodernist deconstructionist theory is reduced to comments about comments about comments. Why, you ask? Because I got this from the comments of [Tomak](http://www.nethercraft.com/about_the_artist.html), who got this from the comments of [a grad student named Thom Ringer](http://www.uoft.net/yrgc/archives/2004_04_18_archive.html), who got it from [The Journal of Social and Political Thought.](http://www.yorku.ca/spot/jspot/) And now I am commenting on it, only to note that it has been commented on. With no further ado, I present the cartoon about Postmodern Toasties. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0007c3hz)
