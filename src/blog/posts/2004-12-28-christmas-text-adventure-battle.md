Amusing meme. :) Unrelatedly, I came across this quote recently and thought you might like it: “Skepticism is not knowing. What we have in our society \[are\] people who call themselves ‘skeptics’ \[but who actually are\] ‘know-nothings’. They’re not people who ‘don’t know’, they dismiss anything that sounds peculiar to them out of hand, without thought, and that’s considered to be ‘skepticism’. And there’s a tendency to believe every stupid fucking thing that comes your way, every stupid conspiracy theory that comes down the pipe… and then there’s the other people who ‘I’m so clever and smart and I don’t believe anything.’ I think that Wilson’s central message is not to get caught in belief, but look in front of you.” – [RU Sirius](http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=58884), Interview in [Maybe Logic](http://imdb.com/title/tt0398191/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9bWF5YmUgbG9naWN8aHRtbD0xfG5tPW9u;fc=1;ft=1), 2004.

I've seen Maybe Logic and enjoyed it very much. I agree with R.A.W. that we shouldn't massage our perceptions to fit an ideological straightjacket. I disagree that skepticism is "not knowing" in the modern meaning of that word. That is what it meant in ancient Greece, but not anymore. I have no problem with someone claiming to be "so clever and smart." I have a serious problem with someone who is content to be dumb as an excuse not to investigate-- if they intend to ever be parents or make any decisions that affect anyone. It's bad enough to dismiss a claim without investigation, but it's far, far worse to believe without investigation. Set the standard of satisfactory proof proportional to the controversy of the claim and its relevance to decision-making. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Here's another quote: "Skeptic does not mean him who doubts, but him who investigates or researches, as opposed to him who asserts and thinks that he has found." — Miguel de Unamuno. This is why I have no beef with debunkers. Those who look for, and find, problems with everything are serving a valuable need. This is true even when the one being debunked is me. They serve me especially then!
