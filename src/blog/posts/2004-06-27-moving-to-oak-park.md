I've found a place to move, and the date is set for the weekend of July 16-18. A big thank-you to and for letting me know that a mutual acquaintance, , was looking for a house-mate in Oak Park! It'll be only ten minutes to work, and my distance from Ann Arbor will be wonderfully decreased. \* Hopefully I can get some moving done on Friday evening and Saturday morning/afternoon before I go to the ConFusion committee meeting, but the rest will be done on Sunday.
