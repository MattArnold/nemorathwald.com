I sent vector art of Tux the Penguin to Leland for him to cut a vinyl banner for Penguicon. His software couldn't interpret the format and this is what resulted. It's interesting from the perspective of unintentional abstract art. Perhaps a commentary on digital format compliance in our day and age? Or just ugly junk; you decide. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0001zc09) Can you find where Tux is?

Hey I thought of you when I saw the headline for the Penguicon article in Metro Times, but I didn't have time to read it yet....

I was among those the reporter took a picture of. Somebody put them up all on the web including me in my costume, but I can no longer find the link.

Right. They only ran two of the pictures in the article. In the link where the photographer put up all the pictures, there are dozens.

Tux looks fine to me. Maybe it's a compatibility issue.
