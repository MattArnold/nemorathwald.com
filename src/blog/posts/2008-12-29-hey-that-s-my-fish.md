I'm at Castle Bradaki, and and 's little girl wanted to play a board game. I got out "[Hey, That's My Fish](http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11936.phtml)" because I knew she could play it. I like that it can be played at a very deep level or enjoyed by a five-year-old. She understands it perfectly. In fact, as it turns out, she's winning.

She's a pretty amazing kid, but I think you should take some credit for being able to explain things in a way that even a five year old can understand.

Now I shall work on how to explain really well, and simultaneously devote some attention to playing well! For lo, Little B kicked my butt at this game.

An excellent game choice, if I may say so. My own five year old loves it as well. If you foresee yourself in this situation more often, there are a few others I could recommend.
