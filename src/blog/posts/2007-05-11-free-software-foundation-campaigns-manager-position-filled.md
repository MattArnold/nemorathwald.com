Here's an update for those of you who want to know [where this stands](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/179611.html). Last week I submitted my resume and cover letter to the Free Software Foundation. I followed up today by phone and was told that the position had been filled. Nonetheless, I have been inspired to think in very promising directions throughout this experience.
