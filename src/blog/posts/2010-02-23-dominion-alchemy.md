This year's expansions for [Dominion](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) have been revealed! A small 12-card set titled [Alchemy](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/66098/dominion-alchemy) is due by Easter, and a full set titled [Prosperity](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/66690/dominion-prosperity) is scheduled for late in the year! That's all we know. From the reaction of uncontrolled squee, rumors, and groundless speculation, anyone would think it was the Boardgamegeek.com equivalent of Brangelina. I am as bad as any of them! The imagination reels with implications and possibilities.
