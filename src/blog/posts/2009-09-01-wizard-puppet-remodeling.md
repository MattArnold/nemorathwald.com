and gave me this puppet to improve. It was little more than a decoration, with bulky strings and almost no control. I attached strings to the sides and back of the head and the lower back. I re-used the original cross controller for the head, connected to the back-post by an elastic cord to keep it aimed forward. It can now look around, nod, shake its head, and bow. Originally the hands were glued to the ends of the orange sleeves. I made jointed arms and black sleeves. I think the controller ergonomics are pretty good, but could still stand improvement in future versions. It was a great practice for making original puppets. Inspiration for this controller design is thanks to [Tony Sinnett](http://marionette-maker.blogspot.com/2008/05/marionette-controller-version-2.html). ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sp2KziPJIPI/AAAAAAAAHEc/ZZTGiAn81hQ/s800/marionettecontroller-bradakis.JPG) ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sp2JwShDb5I/AAAAAAAAHEI/6y5pDX82Xdw/s800/puppetwizard-bradakis.JPG)

All I can say is WOW. I never expected you do such an elaborate job. That's really amazing. I can't wait to see it in action.

I knew you'd make it a lot cooler.
