In this YouTube video you can see me and making ice cream with liquid nitrogen in the room party at Youmacon this weekend. That's my finished Linux-tan sculpture you can see atop the wall unit at the very beginning of the video.

Cool! Of course you then need burgers grilled on an O2 barbecue!

"Yaoi" is a genre within Japanese animation concerning relationships between effeminate gay males. Sometimes they are depicted as some kind of supernatural creature, such as angels. Yaoi is watched almost exclusively by pubescent girls.

I'm at work. Wow, I'm glad I didn't successfully google that.
