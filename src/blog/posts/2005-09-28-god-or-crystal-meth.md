Remember the woman in Atlanta who was held hostage in March by a courtroom shooter, and said she convinced him to turn himself in by "witnessing" to him out of the Christian book _The Purpose-Driven Life_? [Record Online News Wire](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/COURTHOUSE_HOSTAGE_BOOK?SITE=NYMID&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT) reports her new revelations that he asked her for pot, and not having any pot, she gave him some of her illegal stash of crystal methamphetamine instead. It wasn't supernatural intervention that got the fugitive to relent; it was the gunman snorting the happy-drugs to which Ashley Smith was addicted. But the "life-changing power" of a Godly testimony was given the credit anyway, and Smith started raking in money from church-related marketing. From the article: _"Since Nichols' arrest, Smith has received $70,000 in rewards and has been bombarded with offers for books, movies and speaking engagements. Her ordeal has been held up as an example of the redemptive power of faith."_

Ug. I hear (from the \_New York Times\_)that Christians are also trying to use \_March of the Penguins\_ as proof of god and a model of a Christian lifestyle... rather funny. Serial monogamy from year to year and single parenthood, switching custody and never actually seeing each other sounds a lot more primitive church than I'm used to...
