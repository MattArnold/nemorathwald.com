This project sat idle for more than half a year while I was busy with other projects that were more time-sensitive. Click the "sculpture" tag at the bottom of this entry to read the past blog entries on this topic. The silicone rubber mold is now finished on my maquette of Linux-Tan. ![](http://static.flickr.com/47/144282941_17bde62b70_o.jpg) [Here is a photo set of the process of removing the clay original.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/34429085@N00/sets/72057594131930156/) [This photo has mouse-over notes describing what you are seeing.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/34429085@N00/144282941/in/set-72057594131930156/) While I was at it, I also photographed a game board R. and I made ten years ago in college. It's a Mah-Jongg variant intended to teach the Japanese alphabets, hiragana and katakana. I'm not sure where I put the tiles. ![](http://static.flickr.com/49/144280058_ae68ee9e33_o.jpg)

THAT'S what that thing looks like. I've always been curious.
