Finals have been graded. I have a 4.0 grade average. Somehow my A turned into an A+ when I took my final. Maybe the fact that I accidentally completed and turned in an extra homework assignment had something to do with it. The school appears to have changed the requirements for the Web Database Developer Advanced Certificate that I was pursuing, while I wasn't looking. In my perusal today, I no longer see any programs that I want to complete. The plan was to take one more semester, in which I'd take "Web Coding With XHTML and CSS", and "Apache, MySQL and PHP". I still want to take those classes. I just need to figure out how to pay for it.

Several students didn't have one of their assignments complete, and he said they only had to turn in one, either the ATM or the final. It was the first I'd heard of it.

You should look further into your schools policies. When I went to school, it was based on what classes were needed for the degree when you first entered the program, not based on new criteria every year.
