Here's [Cory Doctorow's post to BoingBoing.net](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/22/customers_of_new_uk_.html) today. -Matt

**Customers of new UK ISP get to share all Sony music on P2P** [PlayLouder MSP](http://www.playloudermsp.com/), an ISP in the UK, has secured a license from Sony that allows its customers to legally share any song in the Sony-BMG catalog with any other PlayLouder MSP customer, and to download these tracks from any ISP customer in the entire world. This is such stupendously good news that I frankly didn't believe it. This is what EFF has been calling for for years now, a [Voluntary Collective Licensing Scheme](http://eff.org/share) will break the file-sharing deadlock and give the majority of Internet users who file-share today the chance to get legit while compensating rightsholders. I spent the day going back and forth with the two principles from PlayLouder MSP, Paul Sanders and Paul Hitchman, and based on what they've told me, I'm prepared to say that this is the best thing to happen to the copyfight all year -- maybe all century. Here's the deal. PlayLouder MSP DSL costs about the same as comparable DSL offerings in the UK (though right now, PlayLouder MSP's one-meg speeds don't compare to the high-end offerings from ISPs like Bulldog, who are offering 8-meg DSL). For their money, PlayLouder MSP customers get their regualr DSL lines, as well as: \* The right to share any song in the Sony-BMG catalog \* Even if it's out of print \* In any file-format \* Using any file-sharing software \* At any bitrate PlayLouder MSP's customers' license includes Sony music sourced from P2P networks, ripped from CDs, or digitized from vinyl, cassettes, or radio broadcasts. PlayLouder MSP is using audio-analysis software provided by Audible Magic to analyze the P2P traffic that it can detect on its network and count approximately how many times each track is traded, and will deliver that, along with a cut of its revenue, to Sony. They're also filtering traffic to the Internet to prevent Sony music tracks that Audible Magic recognizes from leaving its network via recognized P2P protocols and going to ISPs whose customers have not paid a license fee. However, they will not be stopping any tracks that Audible Magic fails to recognize, nor will they be resticting traffic using unrecognized protocols. PlayLouder MSP has deals with many indy labels as well as Sony, and those labels will also get a proportional cut of the money that PlayLouder MSP takes in based on their network monitoring. The ISP says that it is negotiating with other major labels and hopes they'll come into the fold soon. They'd be crazy not to: this is free money, just for letting music fans go on doing what music fans have always done. More, this is a chance for the labels to extract themselves from the unsustainable quicksand they've sunk up to their necks in: suing their customers by the thousands in the hopes that some day, with enough lawsuits, the music-buying public will finally see the light and go back to the malls. PlayLouder MSP is live at the end of September if their schedule holds. I'm subscribing.
