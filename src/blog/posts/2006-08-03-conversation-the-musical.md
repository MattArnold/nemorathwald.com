Gerald Gentry brought his computer to [ConVersation](http://www.con-versation.com/) and asked that whenever someone made a comment that seemed inexplicable out of context, they allow him to record them saying it. His intent was to remix these clips into a song, which he has now done [(mp3 link)](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Music/Conversation.mp3). reports that upon hearing my quote (the first one in the song in my jauntiest goofball mode), his laughter was significant enough to physically handicap him.

The song is absurdly fun, and makes me wish even more that I coulda made it to ConVersation... As a side note, you have one of the most easily recognizable voices of anyone I've ever met... great quote to lead off the track.

FYI, it's trav13369 :) And I heard it as well on Monday night, and it made me giggle. Sorry I missed the live version.
