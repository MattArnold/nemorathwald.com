Me: My Mac Mini won't boot. Apple Genius: This blank DVD was stuck in there and the Mac Mini was trying to boot from it. Me: Yeah, it kept spitting out blank DVDs. Apple Genius: It doesn't have a DVD burner. Me: Oh. Apple Genius: That would be why you can't burn them. Me: Oh. Apple Genius: This is the third time you've been in here for warranty work. Bad luck, huh? Me: I wouldn't say that. Since I learned Eduardo\* worked here, it's been fun for him to introduce me to you folks. Apple Genius: Yeah, he talks about you and Penguicon. Oh, did he tell you he doesn't work here anymore? He got a promotion. Me: Good for him! Apple Genius: Here's my card. Email me your resume. \* who brought the idea for Brazilian Beef to Penguicon

I had just replaced the battery on my 1994 Ford Escort last Sunday, because when it died I thought that was the problem. Then I didn't use my car for a week. On Saturday we had a Penguicon concom meeting at the hotel, and I dropped off at the airport which was basically down the street from there. On the way there, my car gave out again. This shows that it was the alternator, not the battery. and Amanda picked us up. took the hotel shuttle to the airport. had a way to help me, so my car is now at home. It will take a while to bring in the income to replace the alternator.

Here's the first set of rubber stamps (as well as the original, transparency, photo-etched matrix, and plate from which the stamps were cast) for my Casual Shogi sets. I made a crucial mistake, but it's recoverable. I put half of the pieces into half the sheet. Then I copied and pasted that group, and rotated it to fit on the other half of the sheet. Then I changed the indicia to the ones that belong on the reverse side of the finished tile. Then I ordered two copies of the sheet. Roll out clay between the rubber stamp copies, peel off the top stamp, cookie cutter the tiles, and you have the makings of a complete Casual Shogi set. The elementary mistake was that since the sheets face each other, I was supposed to **mirror**, not rotate. But I can get a new set of stamps, which I why I said this is the "first set". They'll be just the same, except mirrored to match to these. Then I'll make two sets at a time. It'll cost me another $37, so I have to wait until the alternator is paid for.

I just got done walking five miles round-trip to deposit the cash donated to my tablet fund. Brisk exercise. The tablet order is placed on a refurbished Wacom Graphire 4. It's the penultimate model before the Bamboo line, but Wacom is a highly-compatible and ergonomic brand. 6"x8" is just the right size. It arrives early next week.

Former escort owner speaks: There's also a fusible link between the alternator and the battery. Cheap to replace and a new alternator won't help if this is the problem. You should have very close to 0 ohms between the alternator out terminal and the battery + terminal. If you have a 12V (something), you can try to run it from the alternator out terminal, and it should go. There's also the regulator as a possibility, but I forget if that's internal to the alternator or not. Either way, best of luck.

Did you ever post instructions, or a link to instructions on how to make a rubber stamp?

No I didn't, but I will post about it now!
