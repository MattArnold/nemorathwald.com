For the third time in as many years, I am coming to you now from Java's Cyber Espresso Bar in the Hyatt Regency in Columbus, home of [Origins](http://www.originsgames.com/) and [Marcon](http://www.marcon.org/). My car developed brake and transmission problems on the way to Marcon. Fortunately Freon is here and can advise me. and I will probably travel back home with the gear shift in the "2" position. And my brakes, although grinding horribly because of a broken pad or something, do not need to be changed until after I get back. The convention has been nice. They made custom sushi in Consuite last night. I gave Kendra a much-needed back rub. Our hotel roommates, Jason and Marianna, are fun.
