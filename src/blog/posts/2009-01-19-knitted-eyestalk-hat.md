It seems to me that if I don't know anyone who wants a knitted eyestalk hat, it would have to be due to some kind of disturbance in the force. You might wish to act while you still can.

The only hard part about that hat is finding the eyeball. What did you say they're going for?

Looking at the other photos in the listing, I think the motion of the swinging stalk would make it difficult to miss. It's selling for $45, but since the seller is local, you can probably save on shipping by picking it up.

No, I'm thinking of making my own.

Neat. Expensive. I think it would be cooler with eye stalks all over it. Think eye-of-the-beholder.
