My Dodge Neon can still get me to work, but it's clearly on its last legs with interacting issues between brakes, electricity, overheating and a slipping transmission. I'm looking for a $500 junker to drive to work with for a few months while I save up for a real replacement. Please let me know if you see one. So much for the Washington DC vacation with the family in July.

Nope, you can't have my $500 car ;-) It was great seeing you at Marcon . . .

I forget the name of the place, but I know of a place on Walton (if I'm remembering right, it's near Joslyn) that sells cars cheap. You might want to research going there and seeing what you can find. They deal with impounds and other such cars.

It is in fact on Walton, near Joslyn. It's the V.O.A auto place. Good luck once again! \*hugs and loves\*

You might check Ebay (no, I'm not kidding)

Also, as long as your car still runs, you may be able to gat a decent trade-in value on it, so keep that in mind.

Matt, A friend of mine is ["has" a car for $500.](http://emmymau.livejournal.com/314485.html) If he says it runs, it will. This man knows cars like few others, and he's a good trustworthy person. Good luck.
