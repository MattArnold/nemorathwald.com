Responsible financial management always involves self-denial, but that only goes so far. One gets one the rest of the way with a solid community, and then there's clever resource management. For instance, lives halfway between my home by Detroit and my job in Lansing. Being a co-host on his show (the biggest episode of the year, the one to celebrate the big comedy-music presence at Marscon) adds negligible cost for additional gasoline if I stay the night and complete the trip to work the next morning. So why not?
