I need a storyline for my motion capture animation demo reel, and one came to me in a dream last night. It's called Earth Exhibit. I was on display somewhere with low gravity, along with some other life forms from earth. Specifically, lions. Lots and lots of hungry lions, one of whom had it in for me. The walls of the cavernous enclosure were covered in convenient chain netting for the lions to climb in the low gravity. Fortunately for me, I had been placed in an impenetrable spherical flying craft about eight feet in diameter. There was an open exit to the exhibit. I could fit through it just barely. But my protection couldn't. Probably too ambitious for a five-minute demo reel.

Still, a cute idea!
