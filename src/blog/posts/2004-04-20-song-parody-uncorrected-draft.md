I'm typing this from a computer at work because I left my modem at Penguicon! Steve G. is dropping it off with me at "Tuesdays at Tio's" tonight. While at Penguicon I received a whole box of [TANSTAAFLs](http://www.stilyagi.org/fanspeak.html) for my new role as editor of this clubzine, from the former editor, my friend [Freon.](http://www.lulu.com/freon) I haven't looked through it all yet but there doesn't seem to be any new content in the box to make a new issue out of, unless it's at the bottom. It's true what they say about conventions, it's more fun when you're helping. Of course, it's always a hectic adventure, but I greatly enjoyed doing publications for Penguicon and I'll enjoy even more applying what I've learned to ConFusion. For your amusement, with tongue firmly in cheek, let me share with you the parody I wrote last week about the foibles that beset publishing. It's sung to the tune of "Unrelated Thing" by They Might Be Giants. Why am I on that panel? said the fan I don't remember volunteering or being asked Not at all, not at all Said the editor to the fan You were looking at an uncorrected draft Did we cancel GURPS Horror? said the chair I'm web browsing, I don't find it anywhere Not at all, not at all Said the editor to the chair I was typing from an uncorrected draft Unconnected and free No relationship-- to anything Do we have a TANSTAAFL? said Freon Did you know you're 'sposed to make one for Penguicon? Not at all, not at all Said the editor to Freon I was drafted in an unexpected draft Yes I was drafted in an unexpected draft
