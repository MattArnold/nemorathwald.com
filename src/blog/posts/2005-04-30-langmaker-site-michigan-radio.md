Langmaker, the website about artificial languages, [accepted my submission and posted my article](http://www.langmaker.com/db/log_0504.htm#Logjam) on their homepage. I would have posted about it at the time but I missed it completely while running [Penguicon.](http://www.penguicon.org) In other publicity-related news, Michigan radio ran [a 5-minute spot about Penguicon on "Stateside with Charity Nebbe"](http://www.michiganradio.org/stateside.asp) on Friday, and you can download the audio file [here.](http://www.michiganradio.org/ram/sside04292005.ram) It starts at 10 minutes and 50 seconds into the show, so pull the scroll bar over to the right until it reaches that point. They aired my voice conducting Opening Ceremonies and named me by name! Which is nice for me.
