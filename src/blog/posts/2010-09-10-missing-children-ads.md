I go to the post office a lot. The first thing that confronts me is a missing children poster, the type you get in junk mail. I always have the same thought. Did you know most abducted kids are kidnapped by a parent in a custody dispute? The concept of being kidnapped by one's own parent does not fall within the concept of kidnapping as commonly understood-- a misunderstanding which is exploited by these posters to create the impression of a child in danger. Once again, the problem is who to trust. We don't know the circumstances. Is the "abductor" parent the bad guy? Or is the court the bad guy, reflexively granting custody to the mother, and the "abductor" parent is saving the child from abuse and neglect? Or, is there no good guy, and we are being used as pawns in a domestic dispute full of petty revenge? What annoys me is that this is done under the pretense of a child in danger. These divorce drama-llamas dilute other abduction alerts, which we need to respond to quickly, before the child is killed.
