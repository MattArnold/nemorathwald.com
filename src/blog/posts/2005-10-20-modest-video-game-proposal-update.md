Here is a followup to [my recent entry about "A Modest Video Game Proposal."](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/94649.html) The PC Gaming mod community went ahead and [created the game!](http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000743063662/) It's called "Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator" and brought to life the BanMan's daydream about slaughtering those he considers moral deviants, down to the details of his request. Jack claimed he was just being satirical in offering his bounty, and refused to pay! As those who read [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/) web comic know, Mike "Gabe" Krahulik had earlier e-mailed Thompson telling him he thought his proposed $10,000 charity donation was quite small compared to those given by the gaming industry. Thompson then phoned Gabe and threatened him with lawsuits. In [a story detailed here,](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051019-5458.html) Gabe then sent $10,000 of his own money to the Entertainment Software Association claiming it was on his behalf to pay what he owed! Jack then went ballistic with threats. Excerpt:

_Jack then faxed a letter to the Seattle Police Department claiming that Penny Arcade was "criminally harassing" him, and urging the arrest of "this little extortion factory". At this point, the nerds swung into action. Penny Arcade forum members wrote, edited and sent letters and faxes to the Florida Bar Association detailing Thompson's activities and urging the review of his license to practice law. Jack Thompson has already received a reprimand by the FBA for his antics in 1998, and according to a spokesperson, the letters and faxes have been received and forwarded to the disciplinary committee._

Yup. Just give'em enough rope to hang themselves... ;-)
