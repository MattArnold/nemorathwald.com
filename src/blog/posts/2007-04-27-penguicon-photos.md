These are from [the photo gallery of Orvan the delivery ox at Penguicon.](http://www.conmicro.com/~vakko/conventions/penguicon_5/index.html) ![](http://www.conmicro.com/~vakko/conventions/penguicon_5/penguicon07_0006.jpg) Howard Tayler of Schlock Mercenary drew this for the Volunteering table. Guess who it is. ![](http://www.conmicro.com/~vakko/conventions/penguicon_5/penguicon07_0052.jpg) Bruce Schneier could not be found so ACME delivered his package to me at closing ceremonies. I asked, "Does anyone miss the irony of someone else opening a package addressed to the world's leading security and cryptography expert?" Lo and behold, it was his public and private keys!

I'm still grinning from how well that particular delivery bit went over. I hadn't intended to miss Bruce Schneier, but I think it was far more amusing for far more people as it happened.

But we do know the box was secure. It had "Bruce Schneier" written on it. :)
