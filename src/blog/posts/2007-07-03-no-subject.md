\*sigh.\* The person who left a voice mail to give me a "job offer" turns out to be with Primerica, the multi-level marketing scam. $&!#

I worked for them at one point. If it weren't for the constant Conferences that I was required to attend, it wasn't TOO awful. RXW-80

Yeah, they tried to get me as well... by using a personals dating website!! A guy emailed that he was interested, etc and we talked several times. Wanted to meet, and it turned into a job interview for Primerica. Yuck.

Not to be too nitpicky, but it's not a job interview, because multi-level marketing is not a job. It's trying to sell _you_ something.
