Here I am in the Presidential Suite of a potential 2010 Penguicon hotel, where the party-goers from last night are wandering in from their rest and recovery. Hangovers are light or non-existent, despite the massive quantity of alcohol consumed. There were games. There was a great spread of snacks and soft drinks. There was Pizzacon in this part of the Presidential Suite. In the bedroom of the suite there was Bedcon, which I call a different kind of Game Room. It is great that this social scene is so ... relaxed. And that's all I'm going to say about _that_. Awl. Night. Lawng! (All night) Awl. Night. Lawng! (All night) Everyone you meet, they're jamming in the street, all night long (all night)! **You really need to participate in this convention.** Heck, don't work for it, just attend some stuff and offer to let us entice you with all this awesomeness. You'll come around.

FWIW, I wasn't going to attend Penguicon until a week ago when a friend enlisted my help in making something happen there (not for the con). I can clearly see that \*you guys\* are having a lot of fun, but for whatever reason, I don't feel included at all or get the impression much of anyone cares if I go. I don't say that to sound all whiny or to fish for anything, only to say that somehow OMG We're having SO MUCH FUN OVER HERE and YOU'RE MISSING IT! WE ARE AWESOME COME SEE! does not make me want to come, just feel left out/on the outside/an outsider, so I find I'm curious as to other people's reactions, especially anyone who is not already friends with most of the group. Possibly it's related to my general disinclination to be a bystander/passive entertainee. Or maybe everyone has just figured I'm already too busy to be interested. I really appreciated the one year you invited me to be on programming at Penguicon. Lisa has invited me to be on the program at Millenicon in March and the broad range of items that interested me was very exciting.

Thanks! For each statement. I'll give you an email off-list.
