Saturday and Sunday I amd Alan Contino will demonstrate a magnetic system for capturing a performance as animation, live before your very eyes. If you're lucky, we may pick you out of the audience to wear the magnets. Our exhibit will contain two bonus features: see yourself on a 3D TV, and a character will lip sync to you as you speak into a microphone! [MakerFaire](http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2010/) is like a huge science fair for garage technologists and do-it-yourselfers! There are exhibits both inside and outside Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn. [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/) will be giving out ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. There are model quadcopters, 3D printers, cyborg sensing implants, illusions, robot musical bands, laser shows, [this wild contraption](http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/3896), [this insanity](http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/3835), and much more! Even a statue of Red Green made out of duct-tape, and a go-kart shaped like a Twinkie that fires baked goods. Check it out!
