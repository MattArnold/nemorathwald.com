I've done a _massive_ amount of work for Penguicon this morning. The [FAQ](http://penguicon.org/faq.php) is still wrong... horribly, horribly wrong... About a week ago it was lifted wholesale from last year's site. But I'm editing it as fast as I can, and it unintentionally served as a wonderful planning document.
