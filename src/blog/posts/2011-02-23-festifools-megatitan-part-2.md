1.  Cardboard. **Check** ... although we need more.
2.  Staple gun. **Check.**
3.  Zip ties. **Check.**
4.  Six 6' bamboo poles. **Check.**
5.  Dark green, bright green, and white spray paint. **Check.**
6.  A wide (2" or 3") roll of painter tape. **Check.**

Still remaining to be sourced:

1.  Keychain rings.
2.  A truck to transport it from Ferndale to Ann Arbor by 4 PM, Sunday, April 3, and back at 7 PM.
3.  Green transparent tape for the eyes.
4.  Two very bright light sources behind the tape-- we have little keychain LEDs that would probably not be visible.
5.  Some type of portable battery that can last half an hour, for the lights.
6.  A boom box to project a roaring sound.

I was given a good idea that might work for the truck, but would require a deposit of money.
