ConFusion was a successful con for me. It spent all of the time in the game room, except for the room parties Saturday night, and giving a presentation Sunday. The printer double-folded the pocket program brochure, instead of quad-folding it as I specified. They must have been looking at my instructions for the program book. A lot of people said they liked the book this year. A publisher asked me to bring some of my game prototypes to look at during the con. It went well. I'll blog about that next. I playtested most of my Penguicon expansion for Dominion. ([Man of a Thousand Names, Chuck, Jer](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/346896.html); [ConSuite, Joe, Sal](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/347485.html); [Tracy](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/347858.html); [Aegis, Steve](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/349226.html); [Matt](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/362224.html). Then I ran out of printer ink.) It was popular. I need to make some changes, but I'm very pleased. The game room closed at 10PM Friday night, because they lacked someone willing to guard the game library past that time. That meant the entire spacious Mediterranean room stood empty and locked, while gamers played in the lobby and Consuite. The next day I went to the nearby coat closet and noticed that it was lockable. At the feedback session I suggested that next year they may wish to protect the game library in there after hours, and let us use the dozens of tables unsupervised. The hotel person confirmed that coat closet is indeed lockable, and they seemed amenable to probably let it be used for that purpose. Fortunately on Saturday night, Alex Yeager of Mayfair volunteered to guard the game library so we could game until 4 in the morning, after I was all "room-partied out". If I would characterize my con weekend with one adjective, it would be "lucky":

1.  There were a surprising number of games which I won through more luck than skill.
2.  I was quite relieved to find crash space on Saturday night so I wouldn't have to drive home. I had no such luck finding crash space Friday night.
3.  The AASFA Board held a session to award grant money to anyone who made a proposal for something that would make the con fun. I didn't present a grant proposal this time. Randy Bradakis proposed to buy things from the dealer room and go around the con playing a dice game with attendees to see who would win the items as prizes. I rolled three of a kind in his game and won a copy of "The Windup Girl", by author guest of honor Paolo Bacigalupi.
4.  As usual, I lost things, but this time they were all found and returned to me.
5.  An incident involving whipped cream was the highlight of my weekend.

Perhaps the most important thing for the comfort and social cohesiveness of a con is the quality of its Consuite. This one was kept well-stocked with quality offerings, including fruit, sandwich fixings, tomato soup, breakfast cereal, and an abundance of snacks and drinks. My presentation on Motion Capture Animation was fun and very well-received. I enjoyed expounding on it, until the audience asked about employment prospects, which is a discouraging topic. Earning my mocap technician certificate was one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done, but I will be surprised if I ever recoup the investment. For others, getting employed involves promoting themselves in ways that impress HR departments, which I do poorly. For me, getting employed always involves either a temp agency, or someone who knows me personally and already thinks I'm fantastic. Mocap work is in cities where no one knows me, so I'm not holding my breath.

Yes, we've locked the game library in the closet previous years, SFAIK. At least, I remember discussing lockable storage for it the first two years we were at the Marriott.

Glad to be of service. :) Also wik - so far Matt and Sal are my two favorite PengiCon cards. Sal's awfully useful, but Matt is more fun. Hehe.
