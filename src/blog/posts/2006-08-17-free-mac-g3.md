I'd be happy to take it off their hands. (:

That's a hell of a jinx. :)

Heh. The question is, who owes who the Coke? (:

**[ext_302099](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_302099)** on Aug. 17, 2006 5:55 PM

Or a Mac. :)

Heh. If I could afford one, I wouldn't need to go after \*this\* one, now would I? (:

True.

I do it out of spite, of course. (:

I'm sure I've spited you in worse ways. ;)

**[ext_302099](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_302099)** on Aug. 17, 2006 5:51 PM

I'd take it.

**[ext_525847](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_525847)** on Aug. 17, 2006 5:52 PM

Me!

I'll yield, seems like there are others who would probably have more time for it at the moment than I do.

You weren't first anyway!

Which is why I'm still fighting!
