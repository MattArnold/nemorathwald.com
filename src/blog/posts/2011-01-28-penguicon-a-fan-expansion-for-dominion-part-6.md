In an act of amazing and utter coolness, Rio Grande Games has re-iterated their friendly policy toward fan cards. In so doing, they also asked fan creators help them out, by formulating the name "\[My Expansion Name\], a Fan Expansion for Dominion" and avoid the formulation "Dominion: \[My Expansion Name\]" which is reserved for official expansions. This is to prevent confusion. My original [three disclaimers](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/346896.html) still apply as well. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUM85wHdQVI/AAAAAAAAISo/BQSXCx3SW1M/s400/OpenSodaCard.png) This card can make draw piles as open as the recipe for the [OpenSoda](http://www.opensoda.org/?page_id=2) that Penguicon serves in the ConSuite. Your deck remains face-up, even after you shuffle it. The only way to get it face-down again is to play another OpenSoda. But you can only use each copy of OpenSoda once, and it will throw itself out of the game. There are only ten copies in the supply. Sometimes you want to know "Should I play this card which will draw the next card in my deck?" Well, with OpenSoda, you can put your draw pile face-up. Now you're drawing from what used to be on the bottom, and you will always see what's next. At other times, you have a deck-inspection attack like Pirate Ship, Thief, Swindler, or Saboteur, and you're wondering whether it's worthwhile to play it. If you play OpenSoda against everyone else's decks, you can see if they have some delectable goodies on top, just waiting for your destruction. If someone else does that to you, you can play OpenSoda to put your deck back face down. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUM856tb5QI/AAAAAAAAISk/YPJ8OA6lZ2Y/s400/KimbaCard.png) I wanted to see if I could design a card that would actually motivate players to buy Curses (a negative one victory point card, which doesn't do anything). Normally no one buys Curses. They exist only to inflict on other people. Kimba's "+1 Buy" lets you buy an extra card on the turn you play it. I'll bet you'll use that Buy to get a Curse card, which only costs zero dollars. This card uses Curses as an incredibly powerful fuel. The question is, can you get rid of them by the end of the game? Say what you want about Kimba, she did some things that we don't have anymore, in ways that sometimes went unnoticed. This card is useful too-- if you bite the bullet, make the hard choices, and accept the damage of Curses to your deck. I dare you! They say each good Dominion card tells a little story. The story is about what the card does in the start of the game, what it does in the midgame, and what it does in the endgame. Let's just say the Kimba card had too much of a story on it. I just couldn't fit all the effects I wanted to have. At one point I had Kimba trashing everyone else's Potion cards, because she's a teetotaler. And so on. I was doing too much with one card. So I split some of the effects to their own cards. Like this one: ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUM86IGOjNI/AAAAAAAAISs/UzN4zeM8qYY/s400/WilWheatonCard.png) This card will throw itself out of the game at the absolute last minute. (Perhaps even at one AM on the morning of the convention.) Everybody's holding onto their copies of this, holding out hope, because the earlier you play it, the less it's worth. Finally someone will throw one in the trash to get rid of Gold or Platinum from their opponents. (Canceled plane tickets.) Then all of a sudden everybody is trashing Hhhhhhwil Hhhhhhhwheaton. It's like an extravaganza of Hhwheaton-trashing. Keep in mind that the trashing effect happens when your card gets trashed for any reason, not just when the card trashes itself. If someone hits your Hhwil with Thief or Saboteur, it attacks everyone other than you even though it's not your turn. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUNDXkdDSJI/AAAAAAAAIS0/uzZq8S5qJHs/s400/VaporwareCard.png) I didn't have the heart to put this person on the card. Suffice it to say that when you take on a job and are never heard from again, it is vitally important that we at least get one message from you, acknowledging that you got our email firing you. Otherwise, no one else is able to do your job, because they don't know what arrangements you might be making behind the scenes.

What about a "Capital M Minion"? Or is that pushing it?

Yes, that's exactly what I meant.
