Both a conversation and a document, [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html) is truly amazing! It won't replace email, instant messenger, and online collaborative document editing tools, but when you need all three at once, it can't be beat. For instance, Catherine Devlin and I have been collaborating on the [InForm](http://inform7.com/) source code for "Penguicon The Text Adventure" and I think Google Wave is an ideal space for it. So I would like to move our collaboration there. The first Wave I have received was a group of roleplayers brainstorming how to run a roleplaying game as a Wave. I'll also use it for game design documents, because it can import images and videos, and has wiki-like revision control. It's perfect for collaborating on refining the Lojban language standard and automatically having a record of why each document got to where it ended up. It's ideal for convention sign-up sheets, once enough of the population have their own Wave accounts. And proofreading a convention schedule in a Wave? Absolutely! I'm sure to find far more uses for it. Let me know if you would like an invite. However, I only have a few.

I know this is something I've been looking forward to with glee and dread. I love that you mention my personal hope for it, running a recurring campaign either solely or with the addition of Wave. If you have enough, I'd love an invite.

Put me down for one as well; it could come in handy I suppose.

If you've got an extra, I'd like one.

So far the _only_ thing I've seen for which Wave is IMO potentially more useful than the tools it purports to replace is online gaming. It seems to me to be a hammer in a world without nails.

If it has wiki-like revision control, I must have missed it in my frobnication.
