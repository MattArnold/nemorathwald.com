I'll be in Philadelphia on December 3 through 5, presenting at the Critical Rationalist Weekend on the topic of "Robert Kegan's Framework Of Adult Cognitive Development". I might also submit lightning talks on Lojban, board game design and Kickstarting, how to create lasercut tool paths with Adobe Illustrator, A Historical Pre-enactment Society, and "spimes". \[Edited to add: [I put my talk on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVDqaDH0bf8&t=345s&ab_channel=MattArnold)\]

I think I've seen you write/talk about this topic. Along the lines of https://medium.com/@NataliMorad/how-to-be-an-adult-kegans-theory-of-adult-development-d63f4311b553, right?

Yes, that's right! You probably heard about it on this episode of my podcast: https://fluidity.libsyn.com/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence
