I have a great job opportunity! $18.50 an hour doing print and web for a tools company in Madison heights, with the opportunity to get hired full-time making $40-45,000 a year! $18.50 is half again as much money as I've ever made! This could be the turnaround of my life. My temp agency sent me an email asking me to call-- my agent wouldn't communicate electronically about the position, and wouldn't accept a call from Rachel. The neighbors weren't home to use their phones, so I hiked across town (my tags and insurance are expired) and found a working pay phone where my agent gave me the above information. Now I desperately need a bicycle. The entire city of Madison Heights is within bicycling distance. Please please please give me a bicycle. With it I will secure a working phone, then I will secure insurance and tags, then tomorrow the world. You will be helping make me a successful person. Think about it, that's a good investment.

If you can't find another in time, you may borrow my bike. My bike is one of my most prized possessions, though, so I would expect that it not be left in the rain and that it otherwise be treated like the gold it is to me.

Thank you, that's very kind. If I need it, I'll let you know immediately.

If nothing else, search for your local police departments' auctions. I don't currently have a bike, but the last one I had cost a dollar from the City of Wilmette bike auction, and IIRC, 'tis the season.

can perhaps offer you my bike upon my return from georgia in a week or so. but you'll have to find a way to pick it up, if this bike of mine should sound like the right thing to do.

Thanks! If I still need a bike in a week, what's the best way to get in touch with you?

You could probably have a job making 50% more than that here in Phoenix. And you would have it in a matter of weeks. Plus, you could borrow my bike while you're here. :)

Not trying to convince him or anything are you? :D

Nah! It's too hot and dry here. He would hate it. And in the winter he would have to drive a whole two hours into the mountains just to see any snow or go skiing.

Yeah, but would my rent be $250 a month there? I have no need or desire for that much income. I've run the numbers and all the problems in my life are solved if I ever get to about $35,000. So this job is quite satisfactory without the stress of having to justify a higher wage, and living here I can spend it on what I care about.

It's warm here. You can live under a bridge for free. :) Actually if you shared a place with a couple other people you could easily get to $250 a month. You can rent an entire 3 or 4 bedroom house (1,900 sq ft) for about $900. Actually, it's cool about that job. If you can get your foot in the door and stick around for a year or two, you shouldn't have much problem advancing later as you get good stuff to put on your resume. I say go for it.

The trick will be to keep looking for a better job at all times. That will be almost the only difference between this job and the previous ones I've had. The other difference will be that this job involves the web more than it involves print.

Web is good. And overall I would say you're on a good path forward. It just takes a lot of patience. BTW, one of the new upcoming things to know is Sharepoint 2007. Yeah, it's Microsoft but it's pretty slick. Plus the money gets better the more you decide to learn. It's kind of cool because you control your own destiny in that respect. The more you self-start, the more you get rewarded for your efforts.

You may borrow my bike for the next month (or we'll play it by ear) if you need, but I would like it back. Let me know if you need it!
