I need a dehumidifier for my car. This morning I kept having to pull over and scrape the frost off the inside (yes I said the inside) of all my windows so that I could see. It was like something out of _The Day After Tomorrow._ P.S. Tonight at 8:00 p.m. is the Christmas celebration of the Macomb/Oakland Fan Organization. We are **not** meeting at Denny's this week! We will be at Outback Steakhouse on Schoenner at the corner of Hall Rd./M-59 in Shelby Township, across the street from Lakeside Mall of Sterling Heights. After that it's back to the same Denny's on Telegraph until further notice.

When that happens I ride with my heat on full and one or two rear windows slightly cracked, around 1/4" or so. Eventually the humid air leaves the car and the windows de-fog. This happened to me last night. It took about an hour and a half for all the frost/fog to leave all the windows, but it happened. It doesn't normally take a four hour trip, but that did it.

I hope you can get a defroster or dehumidifier for your car - glad you didn't have an accident this morning. I find it amusing that the acronym for the group is Mofo. Was that on purpose?

Yes, , that was my idea. If you are amused, my work here is done.

I was reminded just last night of a similarly amusing acronym: **S**cience **F**iction **L**eague of **I**owa **S**tudents That's right. SFLIS.

You can also use your air-conditioning to dehumidify the car (I know it sounds weird considering the temps are a bazillion below right now). If you have a switched unit that you can turn on/off without adjusting the other controls you're in luck. If your AC is just a setting alongside heat, vent, defroster, etc. it might be more difficult. Generally the compressor will run on defrost though if it's not there's not much you can do to force it. Once you are able to get rid of the excess moisture it should take a while to come back.

I have never heard of frost on the inside of a car. Did you have this car last winter? If so, did this happen last year too? Just curious.

I had the ability to aim my air at the windshield last year. Over the past couple of years I've had engine overheating problems and ran the heat at full blast even during the summer in order to drain off the heat. During that time, the knob that turns to change which vents the air comes out of welded itself in place. So now I only get air out of my dashboard.

I had a neon at one time. Because of engine overheating issues, almost from day one, the engine was rebuilt at 35K miles. And it \*still\* had thermal issues. I was \*so\* happy to get rid of it...

I see. That would make a difference. Good luck with that.

I'm just hoping nothing is leaking into places it shouldn't; it's rather odd to have \*wet air\* coming from the vents. Either that or you're just breathing way too heavily.

If you're running the defrost and the car is fogging, A) make sure that you don't have the air flow on recirculate, B) there may be a leak in the heater core.
