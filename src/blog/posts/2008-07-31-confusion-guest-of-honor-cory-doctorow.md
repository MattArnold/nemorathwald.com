[Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/) returns to Michigan in 2009 as Guest of Honor at [ConFusion](http://stilyagi.org/cons/2009/)! He was a 2005 Guest of Honor at Penguicon (the first convention ever to make him a GoH), and blew the roof off the place with a tidal wave of awesome. Cory Doctorow makes most of his fiction available on the web for free. Here's the list of specifically hacker-oriented fiction, just because that subset is what I happen to already have on hand: [Little Brother](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/), [Scroogled,](http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/09/google_fiction_evil_dangerous_surveillance_control_1.php) [0wnz0red,](http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/08/28/0wnz0red/index.html) [Themepunks,](http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2005/09/12/themepunks_1/) [Printcrime,](http://craphound.com/?p=573) [I, Robot](http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html), [When Sysadmins Ruled The Earth](http://www.rakemag.com/stories/section_detail.aspx?itemID=24655&catID=146&SelectCatID=146), and [Human Readable](http://craphound.com/?p=526).

Down and out in the magic kingdom started kind of slow and i wasn't sure if i liked it, but near the end it got more exciting Are his other novels like that too?

I didn't perceive it that way, so I don't know. But I do know that I didn't understand what SCtT,SLT was trying to achieve, and I really enjoyed EST a lot.

Great news! And the other guests are very cool. I was in the U.P. the weekend of Davroz's motorcycle accident. Hope he's recovering well.
