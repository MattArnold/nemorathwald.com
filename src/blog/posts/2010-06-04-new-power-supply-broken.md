There must be dirty power to this apartment, because my laptop's new power/supply cord died just like the last one. All the other computers are on an uninterruptable power supply. Except for my roommates' laptops... hmmm...

Do you always use one specific outlet?

No. I use outlets on different circuits.

Are your outlets properly grounded?

I don't know to find out.

It's not to difficult to do with a multimeter. However, I'm going to skip trying to talk you into doing it that way. :-P That whole not wanting to be responsible for other people shocking themselves on my suggestion.. er.. for vanilla purposes at least. \*grin\*

You may want to try a power strip too. If you're getting surges, that might help.

If the powersupply is getting repeatedly shot, it could be the cord wart (the transformer that plugs into both wall and laptop) doing a shoddy job too.

That's what I'm referring to. I thought it was the "power supply". That's what I replaced. Do laptops have internal power supplies as well?

No, the brick is the p/s. Powersupplies put off too much heat and are too big to fit a laptop.
