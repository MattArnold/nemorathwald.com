We will see in about two weeks. They have a couple of other candidates, none of whom they have interviewed yet. That's out of an original applicant pool of 500. I think I was the only one of them who did not actually apply-- they asked me for my resume on the basis of a recommendation. I explained to them the reason I had never applied was that I have no idea as to what kind of position at the Apple Store I would be qualified for. I was burning up with curiosity on that point. They want a record keeper, inventory tracker and phone answerer for the service department. This person would then learn Apple hardware and software with an eye toward becoming either an Apple Genius or a software trainer. I'm confident I can do that, with the level of training they described. I definitely want this job. Thank you for wishing me luck. Continue to do so!

I have faith in your abilities - and so must they (they ASKED you! That's typically a good sign) - so I've gotta say that I think the other interviews are more of a formality.
