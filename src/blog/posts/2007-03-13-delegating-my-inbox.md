My life consists of: 1. work nine to five. 2. wade through hours worth of Penguicon emails and not catch up; in fact, fall even farther behind every day. 3. fall asleep way too late at night. Repeat. For the first time I can remember, my inbox is hip-deep in unread mail. And every bit of it is important. Several subject lines read "I want to be on programming... why haven't you responded to me?" I'm hurrying as fast as I can to respond to you! Well, I am about to delegate my inbox to someone I trust. And now I read one in which the person is upset that she got a message that says I have "stopped taking calls." No, that's the message they put on my phone when they canceled my service for nonpayment! Ughhh.

The message says something like, "Incoming calls have been blocked at owner's request." That does make it sound like you are actually avoiding calls. Why did they choose such an obviously untrue message? As far as the inbox goes, I feel your pain. I hope the delegating thing works well. Now I see why past heads of programming have been so difficult to contact. One of your greatest assets - willingness to communicate - has become a liability. I sincerely hope you are able to figure this out.
