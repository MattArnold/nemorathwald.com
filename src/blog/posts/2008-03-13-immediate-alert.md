I need your help. The Escape Pod Science Fiction Podcast seeks a remote assistant, and that should be me. This job hardly pays any less than my hit-and-miss temp work. This is work that is meaningful enough to me to make me passionately driven. It is where I want to be, and it will clearly lead to more places that I want to be. I need co-signers to vouch for me as a clear communicator, proofreader, and organizer who is consistently available for communication, and who will be driven like a man possessed to succeed at this job. You know me. You've seen it happen with Penguicon. Please go to [this post to the Penguicon blog](http://community.livejournal.com/penguicon/67771.html) and leave your name in the comments there if you agree!
