If I can get a video camera from somewhere, I can post "Ferret VS. Robosapien" to YouTube. However, I will try to avoid constant petblogging, and be mindful that not everyone is as enamored of a pet as their person. :)

Yes, but I'm not a pet person, and "Ferret VS. Robosapien" is pretty funny to watch. Not to mention everyone who comes to the apartment seems to fall in love with that ferret. I frequently fail my "Aw" role around it, and I'm slightly less susceptible than the general population. ;)

You'll have to do some good video editing, maybe come up with a fitting soundtrack. I might be able to find someone to help with the video editing if you're interested...just can't help you with a camera.
