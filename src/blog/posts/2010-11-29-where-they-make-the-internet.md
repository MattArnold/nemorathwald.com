I'm posting this from Ghirardelli Square. I just had caffiene-flavored ice cream with caffiene chips and caffiene sauce on top. But the free wifi is basically what I came here to do. I can't check out whether a city is awesome without looking for free and open internet access. I'm grateful to my hostess for taking me to see the Golden Gate bridge, and the tour of the chocolate making was cool, but what really excites me is the idea of tech tourism. I want to see them roll the rubies over the rails, like our forefathers of yore made it, so that it gets all fluffy and aerated. I know some employees of Engine Yard and IMVU, so with any luck I'll get to see their workplaces. Unfortunately Google [doesn't give tours of their headquarters](http://www.google.nr/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=5d841529a24f3d46&hl=en). It touches our lives every day! How can we not want to see it made? Imagine all those midwesterners gawking and pointing. "LOOK THAR VELMA, THAR MAKIN' THA GEWGUL!" ![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TPQ5DySrh_I/AAAAAAAAINw/f43GxC4YcGU/s288/slugworth.jpg)However, last night I took this photo. It is of one Mr. Arthur Slugworth. He approached me and said if I steal the PageRank algorithm for him, he will reward me handsomely. I said, "you lose! Good day sir!" But maybe he's why there are no tours.

My, you sound a bit more wired than usual! Is it the overabundance of caffeine, or just all teh internets pouring into your brain?

Maybe you'll land the lucky Golden Ticket some day ...
