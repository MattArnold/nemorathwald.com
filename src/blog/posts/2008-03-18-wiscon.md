Is anybody going to Wiscon who can offer me a ride and room share? We can split the costs. There will be an Escape Artists business meeting I want to attend. It will be in Madison, Wisconsin on May 23-26, 2008, the same weekend as Marcon.

I think user polyfrog will be attending. No ride, but may have a room to share, and a pretty nice guy.

let me know if you still haven't found a roomshare. I might be able to hook you up with someone.
