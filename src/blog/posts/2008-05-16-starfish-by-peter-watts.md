Sweet lard and heavenly butter! [Tor.com](http://tor.com/) has just released the latest in their series of weekly free books, and it's a Peter Watts novel! And this is after they just released the Karl Schroeder novel _Sun of Suns_ a couple of weeks ago. Don't worry if you're not into intellectual science fiction. They put out a lot of free books that tickle various brain reward structures, so you're sure to get something you want. It's not always for me, it's not always for you, but it will dispense the distillation of pure Awesome every third pull of the slot machine. Unlike slot machines, it costs you nothing. You should [sign up right now](http://tor.com/). Thank you, Tor! You're my favorite non-audio publisher! Now to take the text of Starfish and convert it through [readthewords.com](http://readthewords.com/).

Hey, you're like a week ahead of me, I just got Spirit Gate a day or two ago! Crazy. (Oh, and spot-on on Sun of Suns... that was FANTASTIC)

Who is your favorite audio publisher? I'm running out of books on tape.

If you're looking for fiction, my favorite is my employer, Escape Artists Inc.! You can get the free short stories from [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org), [Pseudopod](http://pseudopod.org), and [Podcastle](http://podcastle.org). If you want to avoid the hassle of downloading all the years of their back catalog one at a time, you can order it all on convenient compact discs through [Poddisc.com](http://poddisc.com) and I will ship them to you. I also enjoy [Drabblecast](http://web.mac.com/normsherman/iWeb/Site/Podcast/Podcast.html), [Variant Frequencies](http://www.variantfrequencies.com/), and [StarShipSofa](http://starshipsofa.com/)'s weekly story on Wednesdays.
