Don't think of it as spending your time doing artwork with your skills, in exchange for vague promises of future money that may not materialize. Think of it as getting in on the ground floor of a company! The graphics this artist created in response to that proposal? Completely hilarious. [The email exchange detailed here](http://www.27bslash6.com/p2p.html) may or may not be fictional, but is true-to-life.

Site is dead due to bandwidth overrun. All your fault, obviously.
