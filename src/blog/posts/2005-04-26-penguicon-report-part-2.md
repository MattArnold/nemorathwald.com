Our guests may not have drawn crowds but they were the kind of guests that rock the casbah. Each of them was praised to the skies by their fans. Which reminds me: Cory Doctorow lives up to his own self-marketing. He rocked Penguicon. [He _embodied_ Penguicon.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/40860.html) His buddies Joey "accordionguy" deVilla and Wil Wheaton had to cancel their appearances but he did get to see Nat Torkington. I'm still humming the tunes from "Buffy The Musical." That was the highlight of most people's convention, but when I say I liked it I don't just mean I like the performance (which I did), I mean I was glad to be introduced to the songs. Some people really liked my unrehearsed 30-second performance as the Fabio guy who gets rescued and snubbed by . :) Did you see the guy who dressed as Spider Jerusalem from [_Transmetropolitan_](www.transmetropolitan.com)? There have got to be pictures!

Yep, Cory [got a shot of him](http://flickr.com/photos/doctorow/). I'm sure others did too.

Great, but he's missing the jacket and glasses. He actually had the glasses!

Yeah, I know. I saw him in the full getup. That's the only photo I've seen of him so far, though.

I actually made those glasses. Wasn't about to spend $120 on the official pair. And I flicked off enough cameras that someone must have a good shot somewhere. Might wanna post a request in the P-con community, 'cause I wanna see 'em, too. Thanks for the compliments, man.

I don't think I saw him in full regalia, but I think I may have seen his gf tattooing him with marker in the lobby. Since I don't think I've said it yet, you did a great job. :) (As communications guru and Fabio's cousin.)

Thank you! I would be happy to reprise both of those roles. You correctly pointed out in your own con report that communications among staff/panelists were not ideal. At least I created extreme measures to communicate to the attendees to try to compensate for this. And yet even then, I can't communicate what I don't know, and journalism is not suited for me. The kiosks and master schedule will continue to improve.

Do you mean [like this](http://devon.intranet.org/costumes.html)? I complimented them on the tattoos and assured them that nobody would notice if a couple were not quite perfect. He remembered my costume photos, having Googled for images. I'm (in)famous on the internet!

A few [here](http://uhacc.org/~alt_phil/P3/) and a tiny one [here](http://photobucket.com/albums/v292/TVNews/Penguicon/LJ-Small/) are all I have been able to find so far. Quite a few people had stopped to take pictures of us during the nine-hour tattooing in the lobby, so I didn't think to get any of my own until after the masquerade. Unfortunately, the tattoos had gone sort of purple and smeary, and the photos onto a new roll of film, which will have to wait to be developed.
