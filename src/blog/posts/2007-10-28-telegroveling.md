Oh well, at least I can post a picture here. I present the Misinformed Time Traveler. [![](http://lh4.google.com/matt.mattarn/RyUIAgAcRqI/AAAAAAAACQU/vILsppBGJQs/s400/timetraveler.jpg)](http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.mattarn/Misc/photo#5126512555515987618) Anybody want some cake?

**Him:** heh

I don't usually screw up this horribly.

I had hoped that I'd told you the correct date, after realizing that I'd told Bill the wrong one.

apparently not

**me:** look at it this way, if it's any consolation, I accurately took the measure of this trait years ago and decided to accept it! So how bad can it be?

**Him:** meh.

**Him:** Please, apologize profusely to your lovely significant other on my behalf...

**me:** I am groveling at her feet.

**Him:** Consider me telegroveling.

**me:** ZOMG, I can't believe how ticklish her feet are to lips!

ROFLOLMAO

**Him:** OK then... maybe I should leave the two of you and that cake alone. :)
