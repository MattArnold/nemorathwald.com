Now to hear from the bright and happy good news department. What have we got on that side of the register today? - A new client has asked me to do freelance graphic design work! - This weekend is Penguicon! We will once again call carnivals into existence with the power of our minds! - My dad called and said he's got this Saturday off, and wanted to know how much admission to Penguicon costs. He wanted to attend. - Soon I will have the time to resume going to Denny's on Saturday mornings with , and also finally finish playing Pikmin 2. Now to get back to work on preparing for the seven events I am running at the convention this weekend.
