[Entertaible](http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/pictures/entertaible-pict.html) combines dynamic playing fields & levels found in computer gaming with the social interaction & tangible playing pieces of board games. It is a 32-inch horizontal LCD touch screen with multi-object position detection. It's currently just a concept product, not for sale or production. I have been waiting for this since... I can't remember a time when I wasn't waiting for this.

And what would you do with it? (Besides not spill your drink, that is.)

I will have the greatest platform ever devised for playtesting and tweaking the design of new multiplayer board games. Oh yes, and the best possible form of [Penguicon, the Board Game](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/139814.html). Aha. A Ha Ha. Ahahahahaha. BWA HAH HAH HAH HAAAAAHHHH!
