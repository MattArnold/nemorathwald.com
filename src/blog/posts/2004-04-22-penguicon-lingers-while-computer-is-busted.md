After I got home from helping [Tomak](http://www.nethercraft.com/about_the_artist.html) with casting his RenFair fountain sculpture last night, I went about hooking up my modem and trying to finally get back online from home. The computer was going through its usual litany, a series of fatal-error restarts it seems to need to go through every time it hasn't been used for several hours. Suddenly, the power supply went kaput, so now when I press the power button nothing happens. This means there's a great deal of Penguicon still remaining. Let me elaborate. I have yet to: -- use the Linux startup disk, -- hotsync the CD of free e-books to my PDA, -- download a Livejournal client, -- listen to the [Worm Quartet](http://www.flamingmayo.com/wormquartet/) CDs I bought.

You're having computer trouble at exactly the right time. Someone \*just\* gave me a computer that I can pass along to you if you need it. It's a P2-366, I believe. Decent RAM, decent storage. Let me know if you're interested. If you've got my number it hasn't changed.

Chuck, when's the last time someone told you "you da man"? Probably yesterday. Tomak told me he'd have to leave the workshop earlier than usual tonight, so I'd be free to come pick it up if you're not too busy.
