You know I am not having a very good day when I tell a Republican Party Organizer on [PCCboard](http://www.pccboard.com/) the following: [_"If I see even one judge or their families get hurt with the contact info you're distributing, I'm taking your words straight to the authorities to make sure you get put behind bars where you belong."_](http://www.pccboard.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&postid=244311) This is because he said, _"we identify liberal judges. We publish their pictures online along with their contact information. When they make bad rulings, we call them at the office, at home, fax them, email them and let folks know who their family members are as well. ... Federal and state judges do not want to be the next abortion doctors. Nobody wants to walk around with a target on their back."_ When taken to task by other fundamentalist Christians for being a low-rent South American dictator, he replied: _"Don't act so self righteous. We're at war for the heart and soul of this nation and its very survival depends on restoring Godly rule to our country. Unless you are willing to get down and dirty, you won't win, and we must win for our childrens' sakes. Ronald Reagan said it best, "When you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat.""_ Elsewhere on the many mouth-foaming and ranting threads on that site about the Schaivo case, I said this to a reporter (also a graduate of PCC) covering Pinellas Park right now: _"It may interest you to know how these events_ \[you are covering, such as demonstrations and riots and signs saying we deserve for God to shed our blood\] _are being perceived by the blue states. I have met almost no one who cares whether Terry Schiavo lives or dies. By this I mean your opponents are not angered by the thought of her body continuing to live. However, we are angered and scared by the conservative protesters, pundits and preachers who we see on the news and on talk shows. We are not disturbed that they want Terry's body to keep on chugging away, but we are disturbed by their reasons and arguments. There is a lot of talk about the Red States (or as they are now known, the Vegetative States) as an enemy nation like the Islamist theocracies, because of the perfect equivalence of what we hear out of the mouths of the fanatical and gullible mobs that fill their mosques and churches and spill out into their streets."_ This is why the feuds among some of my friends are so unimportant and I take no part. Feuding power struggles or cat fights in a science-fiction fan club reveal an amazing lack of perspective about what is worth getting mad over. I want to tell them, "How can you call this person an enemy just because of your personality conflict? Have you listened to the theocrats lately? You don't know what an enemy is."

I had pondered making a website listing pharmacies that refuse to fill birth control prescriptions, but then decided that I would be just as bad as these right wing nuts. Plus I didn't want to deal with death threats from "right to lifers". What an oxymoron.

You make an excellent point.

You go Matt! I'm conservative by nature but that's just wrong. I heartily endorse your efforts and think you should pass the information to the authorities before anything happens.

Thanks. The Republican Party Organizer who I am referring to, who goes by the moniker of MacArthur Park, has responded by saying I want to put all conservatives in jail to keep our society free of traditional thinking. There's no crime, no crime whatsoever, in having traditional feelings about social issues and desiring that our legal system reflect that. The right to such differences is a big part of what our nation is all about. Threatening the officers of our legal system with intimidation of physical violence is a crime that is unrelated to the motive or the agenda of the crime. It undercuts the rule of law in a society.

What an idiot. The boys with the nifty fold over ID wallets get testy when you ever you threaten any public official, but that is especially true when you threaten a judge. I have got to get into this. Where do I sign up?

If you want to comment on the discussion, go to http://www.pccboard.com/forums/ and click the Register button. Don't worry about the promise they make you sign to not oppose their God and that you will not speak in defense of homosexuality. Others on the site oppose Mac Parks and they have not been kicked off the board for it.

Why would anyone speak in defense of homosexuality?! That's just WRONG! \*evil grin\* Is this the part where I indicate (to those who may not be in the know) that I am in fact gay? :)

You put everything so amazingly well. I wish I could be as articulate as you are on the fly, but at least you have given me a little ammunition for the future. Oh, and as for putting all conservatives in jail to avoid traditional thinking, I would have two responses: 1: No, but I AM willing to jail those that prevent me from expressing my non-traditional thought in a non-threatening and non-violent manner, but so is any defender of our Constitution. 2: Is blindly following a tradition really thought? Thought is only created when the traditions are questioned. You can end up agreeing with the tradition, but you had better have a better defense than "that's the way it's always been." If you don't, then thought has nothing to do with the tradition.
