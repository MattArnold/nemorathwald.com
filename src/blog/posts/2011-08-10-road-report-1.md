I'm in a McDonald's in Toledo, waiting for confirmation of whether the Massachussets leg of the trip will happen. I may have some down time in various cities. Now I'm thinking about where to go and what to look for if I'm looking to make friends with strangers and find out if they know of any local web design/development work. Any ideas?
