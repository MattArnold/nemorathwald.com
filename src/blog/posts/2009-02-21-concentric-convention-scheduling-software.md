Leanne Velhurst just finished showing me ConCentric, an online system she created for scheduling events, presenters and locations at the Capricon science fiction convention I am attending right now. It does everything that I want [CREM](http://www.penguicon.net/projects/crem/wiki) to do.

1.  Convention settings page automatically generates your drop-down list of start times, from 3 pieces of data:

*   start day/time
*   end day/time
*   timeslot length

3.  Catches conflicts of:

*   rooms
*   times
*   participants
*   equipment

5.  Auto-generates:

*   complete detailed schedule for the program book
*   spreadsheet for website/pocket program
*   individual schedules for presenters

7.  As many user accounts as desired

...and so much more. Does she want to open-source it? YES, she will! Here's the thing. It's written in PHP under the CodeIgniter web framework. At this point CREM, being so close in desired features, could be considered a re-implementation of ConCentric in Python. In the interim we can get Penguicon up and running on ConCentric, hopefully as soon as possible.
