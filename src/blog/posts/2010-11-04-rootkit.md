My laptop just got infected with a root-kit, and won't boot. Time for me to use an Ubuntu live CD to get data off the laptop, format the drive, and reinstall Windows. This is right when I'm making the U-Con program book and trying to design at least one webpage for the interview tomorrow. I'll have to use this Mac to finish them. On the up side, now that I'm finally comfortable with most aspects of a development environment, I have a reason to use Linux again. This is an opportunity to go back to dual-booting.

"Dr. web live CD" will boot in linux and remove the infection.
