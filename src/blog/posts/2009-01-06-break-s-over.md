This is why I've been watching so much of the West Wing: But this is why I need to stop and get back to work: paid for a full year of Penguicon's PO Box back during the wrapup and handover, just like she said she did, of course. It turns out the key stopped working as a mistake on the part of the Post Office. Apparently they thought we only paid for six months, or something. I now have our mail. I dropped off the key at the home of . I thought I couldn't even ask the Post Office about it if I wasn't the person whose name it is in. (That is Ron and Kimba, because they did Reg last year.) But told me otherwise, and went with me there to get it cleared up. We _will_ need Ron and Kimba in order to get their name off it and order a duplicate key for the Board of Directors. I have been trying to contact Ron and Kimba every week or so, to find out when they're available. I also stopped by the Penguicon storage cube and dropped off the "Welcome to Penguicon" banner, Steve G's squeaky toy hammer that is useful to call concom meetings to order, the display panel for the capsule toy vending machine, a bag of remnant cloth from the Tux costume, and the half of the game library that we loaned out to MPCon. Did you know Penguicon's game library, intended for spontaneous gaming, includes a copy of the [GURPS Transhuman Space](http://www.sjgames.com/transhuman/) core sourcebook? It is unthinkable that roleplayers will start an impromptu game of Transhuman Space during the convention. But there it sits in the cube, year after year. We are testing out a new possible [online scheduling app, MRBS](http://sandbox.penguicon.org/scheduling/). Unlike DabbleDB, it can catch conflicts in which you schedule two events in the same room at the same time. However, we would lose the granularity and detail that our DabbleDB provides. For instance, MRBS does not let us say which track an event is in, or whether or not it is "just an idea"/"probably happening"/"confirmed". MRBS does not have database entries for individual program participants with their schedules. We're going to have to make some painful tradeoffs. This will be an important topic for the meeting on Sunday. Break's over.

Ahhh...still my favorite show. Jeb is the best president we never had! The cast and characters, their development, their storylines, truly the best work ever done in television. The writers gave hope and justice to an entire nation of people when it was needed.

(Catching up during a break at work.) Not to be a jerk about it, but speaking of painful tradeoffs - when the ConCom meeting was scheduled at someplace with animal allergens, the ConCom opted out of the presence of people with animal allergies.

Yeah, I am puzzled how we are going to discuss this important aspect of programming when we have excluded the head of programming from the meeting.

So, let's have a programming meeting. That's probably a better venue to discuss it anyway.
