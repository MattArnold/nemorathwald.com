My mobile phone service has been temporarily suspended for nonpayment. I pick up my first paycheck tomorrow, but I'm not sure I'll be able to cover the phone bill with what's left. So, for the time being, use my work number, 517-485-2650, extension 232. This will ring on the Voice Over I.P. set up at my house.
