I do not have Asperger's Syndrome, but occasionally I have an Autistic Moment. Several times in my life, I have mistaken the phrase "I don't know how I can be more clear" for a sincere request for a tutorial. I had to learn to catch myself before it is too late.

This really clears up that moment for me. I was worried I had offended.

If I ever say that to you, please, do give me a tutorial! It would be good to get more ideas.

And... it's bad to help people be more clear when they're being insufficiently clear? Am I misunderstanding what your response was, or not understanding why your response was inappropriate?

Sometimes even an appropriate response can be unwelcome, and that makes it inappropriate when one's main goal is to be welcome. "I don't know how I can be more clear" is usually saying the person is already more than sufficiently clear. It identifies the problem as the person who is inadequate in understanding. If the mis-understanding person further mis-interprets that intent, it that only fuels the frustration of the speaker. That adds more heat than light-- enough heat to completely obscure the light.

Generally, when I say "I don't know how I could have been more clear", it is shorthand for "I don't know how I could have been more clear without rendering your involvement entirely superfluous"...and I mean it rhetorically. If I'm curious how I could have been more clear, I usually phrase it as a question. I think the problem lies in that some folks think that the declarative statement above has a question mark at the end.

Lol if this s in response to you and I on thursday when I said I knew I wasn't communicating clearly I recognized I was very much confusing matters and putting in too much at once whict I tend to do at times. I find I can get 'stuck' in my speech because my brain is moving faster than I can spit the infomation out. Which happened to me Thursday. I think the rest of weekend I was ok. But I recognize you and I think and process information very differently and I was trying to adapt to what you needed from me. Not sure I suceeded well or not. :)
