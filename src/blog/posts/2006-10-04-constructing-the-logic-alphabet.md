![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/flipstick-new-CMYK.jpg) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/SZ-garnet-new.jpg)I really like [the Logic Alphabet](http://www.logic-alphabet.net/) and would like a hands-on understanding of [how it works](http://www.logic-alphabet.net/mirrors_title.htm). In particular, the tools delight me. I would like my own. [The inventor says](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/18/crystal.php):

> _For most people, if they have encountered logic at all, it has probably seemed complicated, difficult, and full of abstract rules and symbols. My system is like a game whose simple and explicitly exposed structures enable you to easily understand the basic principles of logic, and even to begin doing some elementary constructions without learning any complicated rules. This is because the geometrical model on which itâ€™s based can easily be embodied in objects you can manipulate with your hands and eyes. In fact, you can just play with the system as an interesting set of patterns in its own right. By flipping and rotating the elements you can explore the symmetries embedded in the system without seeing it as a way of modeling logic._

![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/Figure4bug.jpg)What they need is a set of photographic "How-To" workshop guides on the web, showing step-by-step digital photographs of how to construct a Logic Bug, Flip Stick or Logic Garnet. I would enjoy creating such a guide to the Logic Garnet. It would be even better as a table lamp! But I had better not risk electric shock from such a project. If any of you know how to make a jig with which to drill a hole directly into the corner of a wooden block, please let me know.
