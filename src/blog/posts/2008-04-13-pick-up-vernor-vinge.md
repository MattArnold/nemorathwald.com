I'm looking for someone responsible and trusted within Michigan's fandom community to pick up Vernor Vinge from Detroit Metro airport at 4:10 PM on Thursday and bring him to the Troy Hilton. I'm Mr. Vinge's before-the-convention liaison, and

[![[info]](http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif)](http://brendand.livejournal.com/profile)[**brendand**](http://brendand.livejournal.com/)

is his at-the-convention liaison. As it turns out, this particular task exists in a state of quantum indeterminacy, either before or at the convention, depending on how you understand it.

and I both have to work at that time.
