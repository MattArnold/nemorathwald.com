Not only does this video encapsulate why I don't like working for clients, it also resembles several confrontations over badge rates during the Penguicon weekend.

heh, yeah. The last bit, where he tells the chef that he needs him to tell how he made it... I can relate to that, for sure. It happens pretty often in the arts, sadly. "Paying" a compliment and then asking how it is made so one can reproduce the effect (and probably sell it too) pretty much negates the compliment. Fortunately, my interactions with my clients tend to be wonderful positive experiences the majority of the time. \*yay\* for that.

Lol, I love this because I'm both people at different times! When I freelance, I'm constantly plagued by folks asking "hey, can you show me how to do this so that I don't have to call you for every little thing" which really means "can you show me how to do this so I don't have to pay you anymore". On the other hand, when I'm negotiating, I'm all about "yeah, I'm not paying full price, you can do better"..heh I'm a dick!

I'm not offended when asked how to do something that I could charge for. First, I learned it myself and have not had to pay anyone to do it, and that was fair. Second, many people will do it better for their particular application than I could, because they know the people intended to look at the design and I don't. Third, if they can't do it as well as I can, or if they decide they can't afford to spend the time, they'll come back. I tend to see my skills as easily replaceable, but ultimately, work is not replaceable.
