That would make a great bumper sticker if I could understand it.

I have realized more and more the value of being publicly excited about things. People will want to get involved. Too high a ratio of complaints gives the impression that if they get involved, they'll be the next thing to be complained about. I do not draw from this a lesson that we should fake a good mood, or that we should live in denial about our problems. It's just better to be careful airing our dis-satisfactions in public, and look for a high ratio of exciting topics of conversation.

I wish that my experience matched this sentiment.
