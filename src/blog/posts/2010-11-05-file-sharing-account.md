Two things. 1. Can anyone give me an invite to Demonoid or a comparable private torrent site? For some reason, my Demonoid username and password don't work any more. I really need it now that I had to wipe my computer. 2. I left my backup flash drive in the USB port while I installed Windows and Linux. One of them formatted it. Fortunately I backed up on J's server a few months ago. Of course the nature of web development work is to be online, so I've got that too. I also tend to email things to myself or others. I'll have to start the U-Con program book from scratch. I'll have to start over on the most recent Penguicon Dominion cards. I lost my Minecraft save files, but that's no great loss to humanity. I lost my Anamanaguchi MP3s, but can download them from the site again. What worries me the most is losing my most recent motion capture work.

We have pdfs of last year's books if you need them. Sorry to hear about this. Anything I can do to help? :(

Even with PDFs of the books, I'd need to start over. What I would need are the InDesign source files. Fortunately I backed up the InDesign source file of last year's book on the home server. I'm not too far behind. It occurs to me that I should email you the source file of each program book for safekeeping by the convention. So, that's how you can help.

Bug me tomorrow, and I can probably grab you a Demonoid invite.
