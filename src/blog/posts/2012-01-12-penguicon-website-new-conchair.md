Sorry for the delay, but [Penguicon 2012](http://www.penguicon.org) has a website now! For some reason, nobody could get the new custom CMS working on Penguicon's server. They finally settled for Wordpress, but it still uses many art elements from [the design I made nine months ago](http://www.arnoldworks.com/?page=web&item=3). It's something to build on! Also, you may have heard Penguicon's absentee conchair resigned, and there is a new one. Well, I had to remind myself hardly anything has ever gotten done until January anyway. Let's all award a million Internets to Chuck Child for stepping up to the job!

Do you know what I love best about the Penguicon site? They made the main pieces re-size with the browser width, so that if you've got your browser opened to a large size, you're not staring at a vast expanse of background with a teeny amount of content. So easy a change. So few Wordpress sites that use it.

Thanks! I share your annoyance to that as well, so I made sure to set the site to do so. I believe I have it still capped at ~1400px or so, so there's still some space wasted if you have a 2560x1600 display.
