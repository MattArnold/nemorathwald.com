\-- My computer is back working. I've had the best possible outcome, considering when my last computer wouldn't turn on it was due to the power supply, and the surge fried the CPU and hard disk on that one! That was more than a year ago-- in this week's "crisis" however, my current computer is in complete working condition with merely a new $4.99 power cord. -- Let me just say any time Charlie Kaufman makes a movie, I know I want to see it. _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ is now one of my favorite films. (Another writer whose movies I consistently like has been Andrew Niccol, writer/director of _Gattaca, The Truman Show,_ and _Simone_.) -- It's such movies that make us truly appreciate, by contrast, the depths to which bad movies can sink. I went to [thatguychuck](http://www.livejournal.com/users/thatguychuck/)'s house this week to watch an incredibly stupid 80's zombie movie that Tomak provided, called "Bride of Re-Animator." Tomak finds it hilarious. It was a fun time. Our favorite line: "Oh my god; they're using tools!" -- My brother Andy bought a book in the Penguicon dealer's room about how to survive a zombie attack. He thought it was humor, but remarked with amazement as he read it that the author seemed to be perfectly serious... -- Tonight I'm going to poetry night at Trixie's Coffee Shop. I hope to spend time there more often.
