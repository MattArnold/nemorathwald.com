I used to bicycle to work, five miles each way, and it was great. I got a lot of exercise, which made me sharper, more creative, and more enthusiastic. When spring came, I realized someone had broken the chain and stolen my bike out of the back yard during the winter. There is a seven-mile bike trail from my apartment to my college. I'd like to take advantage of it, but the big problem would be where to keep a bike. I'd keep it in the storage cage in the laundry room, except it is packed to the gills with PodDisc.com shipping supplies, copies of The Complete Lojban Language, project tools, and etc. Maybe I could sublet a storage cage from another resident?

Get a folding bike and take it wherever you go?

I realize I'm not answering your question, but I have a bike I'm not using. You wanna bike? Cheap?

If I fix the storage solution, I'll definitely make a deal. Street bike or mountain bike?

What's your apartment like? They have racks now to hang a bike on the wall. http://www.amazon.com/Topeak-Wall-Mount-Bike-Hanger/dp/B000ZKCLIO We have a device waiting to be installed that lifts a bike up and allows it to hang from the ceiling. It was about $10 at Menard's. Like, this, only less expensive: http://www.bikerackshops.com/PBH-1R.html This will turn your bike into modern art, and you can't get much more minimalist: http://www.bikerackshops.com/AR001BRS.html I'm assuming that you don't have a balcony that the bike could live on, and that you don't feel safe just locking it up in the laundry room.

Wow. I expected a bike rack to cost a lot more than that. Unfortunately, in order to fit into this apartment we have installed shelves everywhere.
