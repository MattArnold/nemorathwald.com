Well, that was instructional. To recap: [I found a nice old PC in the curbside trash.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/199578.html) [I tried to upgrade my Linux box running Ubuntu to the latest version, "Gutsy Gibbon"](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/201575.html), but it only would boot to a command line. At this point I still had not done anything with the curbside PC-- we're talking about two different computers, just so we're clear. Well, this evening I took both the hard drives out of the Linux box, and put the 160GB hard drive from the curbside PC in there. I formatted what's-his-name's data, and installed Ubuntu Gutsy on the curbside drive, mounted in the Linux box. It only booted to the command line, precisely as it did on my computer's previous drives. This means the problem is either on the Ubuntu installation disk (which passed an error check after I burned it), or in my BIOS or graphics card or something other than the hard drives.
