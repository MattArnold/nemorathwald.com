Friday the [gaming group](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/semi-abstract-gamers/) met at my house, and Rachel and my brother Andy joined us. Rachel provided the snackage and as usual went way overboard on buying stuff. But hey, if she's paying for it... such "problems" we should have! Thanks Rach! We played much [Navia Dratp](http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/naviadratp.html), as well as [Clans and](http://boardgames.about.com/cs/designergamervws/gr/clans.htm) [Hell Rail.](http://www.coolgames.com/mfg-cat/general/0476-00.htm) I went to the [Michigan Rennaissance Festival](http://www.michrenfest.com) Saturday with Rachel and Andy. We sat at a crawl for more than two hours on I-75 which was narrowed to one lane, but when we got there it was fun! I bought a wonderful leather mask. I hate to admit this, but sometimes fairy princesses kick monster ass. Yesterday, my brother had my back to the wall playing Navia Dratp, all I had left was Navia + Pawn. He had several impressive warriors and I almost conceded. But he didn't notice I collected all the currency in the game. He was going to checkmate me on the next move, when I paid everything to invoke Navia Dratp and that was that. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, I guess. These four huge juggernauts surrounded a fairy princess and she blew them away in a single stroke... it was rich, I tell you. I love a game that's full of surprises without resorting to dice.

YAY on the maskage! I remember you looking at the one in the store. What exactly were you looking for the mask for again? \*hugs\*

I was looking for a mask for protection from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Trall. According to Douglas Adams in _The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,_ this creature is so stupid that it thinks if you can't see it, it can't see you. "Wait a moment," I hear you cry. "That makes no sense at all. You can still see it through the mask." No I can't, because I can't wear my glasses while wearing the mask. In that case it doubles as armor for my nose when I bump it on things. The truth is that I bought it because it looks nice and I fancy it.

It was a very fun weekend. I'm very pleased with my gypsy outfit, such beautiful sleeves. You are quite welcome for the snacks. You know what they say...never shop hungry....

It's not a complete outfit. It's a cute tied black top with long flowing sleeves that have hand-stitched ideas of flowers and then I tied this shiny black and gold shawl around my waist. It was very cute indeed. I spent too much money though. Oh well. Where else can I get such fantastic stuff? I'm only sad that it is most comfortable during warm weather and I live in Michigan...Oh well. I hope to buy the coin bra, skirt, and colorful apron-like material next year.
