Scientists and philosophers of science are auto-tuned to break out into song, in [these music videos](http://www.symphonyofscience.com/) of clips from shows such as _Cosmos_. Featuring the words and voices of Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Feynman, Bill Nye, Robert Jastrow, Richard Dawkins, and Michio Kaku. "I know that the molecules in my body are traceable To phenomena in the cosmos That makes me want to grab people in the street And say, HAVE YOU HEARD THIS?" - Neil deGrasse Tyson

I love that video so much. It makes me cry a little bit. :)

I love these for simple and complicated reasons. The simple reason is that they're just a cool trick. The complicated reason is that even now, many years an atheist, I still get the tingles from certain kind of church music. It's nice to find something that affirms a materialistic agnostic viewpoint and yet gives me the tingles in much the same way.
