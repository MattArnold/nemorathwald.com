I finished the project I mentioned before. I illustrated a slide presentation "Fundamentals of rationality" by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I have added most of them to my portfolio for your viewing pleasure, starting [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.mattarn/Portfolio#5360922883136967490).

I have now begun work on his next presentation, with pictures that are frankly even cooler! But I only have a week to do this one.

Awesome! I love it when you do drawings. :) I like the people and monsters the best.
