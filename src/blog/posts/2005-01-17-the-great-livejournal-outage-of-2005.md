"What did you do while LiveJournal was down?" I spent the night at Blasted Bill's place and manufactured new feet for the Tux costume. I rubbed my fingers raw while sculpting a foot in modeling clay. I must remember to use wood tools or mineral oil when working on so large a scale. Then we put it in a box and poured 18 pounds of plaster on it. After this cured, the clay was removed. For each foot, we put on thin petroleum jelly, then a thin coat of caulk is applied to serve both as impression coating and release agent for the next layer, which is a can of sprayable foam insulation.

Compared to making the rest of the costume, this is normal. :) When working on any project, Bill and I have extremely complimentary skill sets. He pointed that out again this weekend and said, "I can build structures. You can make them look good." I said, "Let's do that to Penguicon."
