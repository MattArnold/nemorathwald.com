My car is fixed! And affordably, too. It was just a leak. I plan to be at [U-Con gaming convention](http://ucon-gaming.org/) November 11 through 13. It has a new home, at the Metropolitan Hotel in Romulus near Detroit Metro Airport. I think this is a great move! Check out what they now can offer.

> Moving out of the confines of the Union allows us to offer some things we've never had before: FREE PARKING. Let's say that again: parking for U-Con won't cost anything, and you don't have to worry about tickets! This has been the most common complaint we hear about the Union, and believe us, the staff have shared your pain. All events on one floor, with convenient access to exits for wheeling in carts of minis or dealer merchandise. We're in a hotel, so we'll be able to offer rooms on site at a discounted rate of $65 $60/night (a limited number of larger suites are also available; email us for info). 24-hour gaming space. Free WiFi access in all function space. Free continental breakfast for hotel guests. Free shuttle to and from airport

Agreed. But I worry that they won't make their room block because they're not really advertising that gaming will go on after 12...
