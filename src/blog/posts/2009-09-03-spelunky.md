Can I get a PC game pad from somebody? [Spelunky](http://www.spelunkyworld.com/) is a free PC game currently getting rave reviews. I adore it! This 2-D action platformer looks simple, but there is much more to it than meets the eye. The more I play, the more depth I discover about how to play. It teaches you the basics and lets you learn the rest through experimentation. "Well, you can't do _that_." "Really? What if you get the right item and use it with that like this?" _or_ "This game doesn't have that feature." "Are you sure?" _or_ "Video games never let you do that." "But didn't you ever want to try?" A warning, however. It is mercilessly difficult. You never get a second chance to do anything, because there are no save points or lives, and each level is generated brand new every time. Best of all, the source code will be released for endless mods. Yes, this game is open source. I've drawn up a quick sketch in tribute. I finished it without much in the way of shading because I couldn't wait any longer to tell you about this game. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sp9YjK-1vII/AAAAAAAAHEo/g1-RINJYexQ/s400/spelunky1.gif)
