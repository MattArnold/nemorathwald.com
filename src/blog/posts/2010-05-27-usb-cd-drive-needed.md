J doesn't have a functioning CD and/or DVD drive on her laptop right now. She needs to borrow an external USB one for a week or so to perform an install. Can anyone help?

I might not be of any help with this, but.. Is it an OS install? and if so, can the machine boot off a flash drive? If so, she might be able get an ISO made from the CD/DVD and then put it onto a flash drive. Assuming it's PC-like.. not sure about macs. My laptop doesn't have an optical media drive, so that's what I've been doing. If it's just a software install.. might still be able to do something like that.. copy the files to the flash drive on another computer. I've got nuthin'.

MicroCenter sells USB to IDE/Laptop IDE/SATA adaptors for $15-$20, though I've never tried it with my IDE DVD burner.
