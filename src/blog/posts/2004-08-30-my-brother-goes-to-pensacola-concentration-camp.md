_8/31/04, Edited to add: Oh yes, in my haste to describe the abuses I forgot to mention it's not accredited either. Putting up with four years of PCC accomplishes a diploma that isn't worth the paper it's printed on._ This week my brother is leaving to attend his first semester at my alma mater, Pensacola Christian College. Those of you who know me are aware of [my views on that.](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Why_Not_to_Choose_PCC.htm) PCC bans the internet, forbids visits to off-campus libraries, and restricts speech to compliance with their narrow interpretation of doctrine. Maybe he has carefully considered that and sincerely decided it falls within educational goals rather than indoctrination. Perhaps after thoughtful review of my stories of [wiretaps, mail opening, secret search and seizure and reporting on each other,](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Why_Not_to_Choose_PCC.htm#Education) and students suddenly being cordoned off incommunicado, interrogated and expelled in the middle of the night-- he may have decided it's exaggeration. After all, describing PCC as a non-violent version of the Taliban does sound like hyperbole to someone who hasn't experienced it. Or perhaps instead he's settling for a lot of disagreeable things because it's the easy way, being so inexpensive. It also makes the throng of aimless 18-year-old confused muppets who wander through its gates look like stalwarts of spiritualized purpose to their parents and pastors. Which way he's taking is not for me to judge. Either way it's his life and I respect him doing with it as he wishes. Perhaps he's strong enough that a dozen repetitions of "Have Thine Own Way Lord" eight times a week will not lull him into a trance. But I'll be here for him when he wants to know where to find the gaps in the compound's barbed-wire fence. My advice to him: 1. **Read the dictionary definition of the word "fascist."** It is not just an empty slur related to Benito Mussolini. It has a content. People of good will are opposed to that content. 2. **Read George Orwell's "Animal Farm."** See the made-for-TV movie of it if possible, to help you visualize. 3. When the administration or their henchmen tell you that they watch for your souls, **visualize Napoleon the pig from "Animal Farm"** standing behind the pulpit, waving a bible. 4. Read George Orwell's "1984." **Learn what "doublethink" and "groupspeak" mean.** 5. A secret between two people is not a secret. You never hear about anybody getting away with breaking the rules; that is because everybody who tells people gets caught. **Trust no one.** Those who you trust will be taken to an interrogation room and broken down until they turn you in. 6. Do not confuse illegal and immoral. To **keep them from deadening your perception of moral realities**, you must **maintain a separate identity.** So excercise secret civil disobedience at every prudent opportunity, just for the principle of it. Even little things will help. 7. When under pressure in the Dean's office: **do not sign anything that they command you to sign.** They are setting you up to get their final licks in because you have dared to free yourself. 8. **Call a lawyer** if your legal rights are trampled on. It works! 9. If you call a lawyer and someone quotes the scripture about not suing Christians, **visualize Napoleon the pig from "Animal Farm"** standing behind the pulpit, waving a bible. 10. Most importantly, **always remember that "resistance is NOT futile."** You can escape. You can get a loan for a secular college. You can recover. It will not be the end of the world. Whatever consequences you face for leaving will be worth it.

Hear, Hear!!!!!! I hope your brother actually reads these words. He as noooo idea what a hornets nest he is walking into. I'm still healing from the psychological scars of that den of vipers. At least he is a "man." Girls had it much much worse. For one thing, girls tended to buy into that backstabbing thing more than guys. It is simply more dangerous in a girl's dorm. Did you know that guys had more opportunities to date on the outside and leave campus? I hope your brother learns to think for himself and not to please others. I hope he sees the disgusting hatred and the blinding stupidity. As for going to that excuse of school for academic reasons. Good luck finding academic integrity. They filter out so much facts just because they are uncomfortable or put their own filter on things even in biology and math. How anyone can consider themselves fully educated with only that school, I'll never know. He better expect to read lots and lots of non-shcool material if he hopes to be knowlegable in his field. I hope he wakes up to reality of life. Life without college to back you up has turned out to be difficult financially. PCC is simply not an accepted college for valid reasons. I suppose if he does read this, he will know were to turn to for help when the time comes. And if he is awake at all, the time will come.

Agreed. I'm starting at my community college this week, and when my academic advisor found out that my PCC credits were unaccredited, you should've seen the grimace and then scowl on his face. Not good. I'm having PCC transfer my transcripts, but I'm not feeling good about the possibility of them being accepted. I do hope I'm pleasantly surprised in that regard. I hope you're brother is made of tough stuff. He's certainly gonna need it.

I am afraid that your brother is now going to turn against you my friend. Good luck with the emotional and spiritual brainwashing that will occur. He will be assimilated into one of the mindless collective that makes up the Beka Borg! The real world is out there, and until I took the red pill, I was stuck in a matrix of lies, deception, and utter nonsense. Christianity in general is a very pompous religion, full of egotistical people who claim to know the only way to get to heaven. They blame all their problems/sins on Satan, a fictional character they made up to mimic the look of the pagan hunter God. Meanwhile, all their holidays are created and take place after the pagan holidays. The problem with the christians are they try to wipe out the other religions of the world, claiming theirs is the true religion. Your brother is in for a world of hurt, and it seems to me that he does not value your opinions. If he did, he would have thought twice about PCC, even if he still wants to be a christian. It is a evil place...

Congratulations on your own survival. Good luck to your brother. And people try to convince me that Christianity is not a cult. Yeesh.
