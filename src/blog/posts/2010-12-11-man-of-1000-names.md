Our friend MOATN has finished the project which he began about two years ago, to change his name every day for 1000 days. Here is his announcement of his one thousandth and final permanent name. If you just listen to it, and don't watch the video, you're missing out on the signs and other visuals! Congratulations, MOATN, on this momentous occasion!

So, um, is he psychic, or is the "December 11, 2011" a typo?

It must be a typo!
