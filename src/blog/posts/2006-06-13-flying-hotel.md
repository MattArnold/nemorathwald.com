Here's a link to a website of [futuristic projects of a vacation destination company](http://www.watg.com/project2_watg.cfm?categoryname=31%3CF%2EJY5Z%20%24%2AZD%21E%2DB%2F8T%40IZ%278%20%20%20%0A&tableid=%21%24%20%20%20%0A). There's a city on a ship, a orbiting resort, and an undersea hotel. [![](http://63.240.68.122/FirmFiles/21/images/aeros1%2Ejpg)](http://www.watg.com/singleproj_watg.cfm?categoryname=31%3CF%2EJY5Z%20%24%2AZD%21E%2DB%2F8T%40IZ%278%20%20%20%0A&tableid=%21%24%20%20%20%0A&projectid=%25%25XW%28%5B%5D%5C%20%0A) I would love to host a science fiction convention aboard [this flying hotel](http://www.watg.com/singleproj_watg.cfm?categoryname=31%3CF%2EJY5Z%20%24%2AZD%21E%2DB%2F8T%40IZ%278%20%20%20%0A&tableid=%21%24%20%20%20%0A&projectid=%25%25XW%28%5B%5D%5C%20%0A). I expect the biggest challenge of this facility to probably be the plumbing. "Its 14 million cu. ft. of helium will provide lift for two-thirds of its weight, with jet engines providing lift for the other third." It's estimated to be completed in 2010. It would have a restaurant on board, which would have to be at least as expensive as most hotel restaurants. But needless to say, it would not have cheap restaurants within walking distance. \[Spotted at [BLDGBLOG](http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/resort-hotels-of-stratospheric-future.html)\]

I used [this mother](http://www.freedomship.com/freedomship/gallery/old/image.shtml) in the 2032 part of _Brasyl_

Wow. Another delicious benefit of a flying or floating facility would be that we could fly to Australia or British Isles and pick up our GoHs, instead of flying them to us. That's where the most cutting-edge SF authors seem to be these days, much to the chagrin of budget-conscious concoms of mid-to-small American conventions.

I suppose that 14,000,000 cubic feet sounds more impressive than 3,418 cubic furlongs...

Or 300 cubits by 50 cubits. Now _that_ certainly brings up interesting mental images. There was once a Hanna-Barbara cartoon titled "[Yogi's Gang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi%27s_Gang)" that depicted a flying Ark.
