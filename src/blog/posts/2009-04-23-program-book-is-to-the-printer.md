I'm very proud to say that thanks to the diligent attention, detailed agreements on process, and clear communication of expectations on the part of so many people, this year's Penguicon program book is an almost completely correct document. I don't envision much of an errata sheet. There it goes, with the click of a button. For better. For worse. (Almost entirely for better, fortunately.) You can find a tweak here, a jot there, but the _process_ is done. We have emerged from the neck of the bottle. Eighteen months of planning, now in the past. The rest is execution of the plan. Yeah, there's also a convention weekend yet to come, but I have almost no concern about that-- you guys always show up and do your magical thing. But the stuff we can't change; the deadline; the commitment of our hard work as ink on unchangeable paper; is as of this moment transformed into an indelible manufactured object.

Awesome. I'm glad to hear it. Tomorrow night I'm dropping off the vending machine with Nathaninja for Morton's List purposes.
