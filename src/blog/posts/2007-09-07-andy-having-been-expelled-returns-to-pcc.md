After Pensacola Christian College expels a student, they allow him or her to return after a year. My brother is taking them up on that. He went back last week. He says only that he has his reasons. For those desiring background information, here are my previous posts about my brother at PCC: [My brother goes to Pensacola Concentration Camp](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/21323.html), August 30 2004 [Nightmares](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/21977.html), September 2 2004 [Andy returns to PCC](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/39227.html), January 20, 2005 [My brother got shipped from PCC](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/162713.html), December 6 2006 Returning after having been kicked out for something so pointless is like a woman who keeps returning to a husband who beats her. He's very much like I was at that age: imaginative and smart; passive and unmotivated. Philosophical enough to be religious, smart enough to see the stupidities in the dictates of authority, while postponing responsibility to take control of adult life as long as possible.  Clearly by this time he could have achieved escape velocity from that terrible gravity well, and is making a free choice not to. I'm not very worked up about it. I don't need to correct my own youthful mistakes vicariously through him. [Paul Graham thinks that in the new economy, it's a lot less important which college you go to.](http://paulgraham.com/colleges.html) Still and all; it's a shame to waste money on brainwashing.

_Returning after having been kicked out for something so pointless is like a woman who keeps returning to a husband who beats her._ Have you brought this up to him?

Since he knows how I feel about it, and has clammed up about his reasons, there seemed little point. Granted, Scalzi's law (see Scalzi's comment to my last LJ entry) states that he will find out anyway; but my reason for not saying it had nothing to do with preventing him from finding out I think this. Rather an acknowledgement that it would be nothing new. It would be the equivalent of my dad telling Andy to throw out his copy of _Hellboy_ because demons and other such comic-book creatures are real. There's little point telling someone something that you believe, when you know they don't believe it and it will mean nothing to them. Our family has unwritten and unspoken rules, and one of them is that you are forgiven for stating what you believe in blogs or behind pulpits, even if it would be considered antagonistic if said directly.

Ah. It's just scary thinking about an institution being run like this. I could possibly see a high school setup like the one you described in the 6-12-06 post, but a college? Maybe I'm just TOO... something. Liberal?

Too freethinking.

Here's hoping your brother figures out what he wants to get out of this and either takes it and runs or just runs and gets it somehow else.

Time to revisit your idea on the underground railroad. You and your brother are in my thoughts.
