If it's not one thing it's another. I had to leave my car at work because once again it wouldn't start, and just this minute, the ceiling of the kitchen collapsed! The entire floor is ankle-deep in insulation. ------ I almost had it half-shoveled when I remembered that thanks to , I now have a camera.

First thing I thought of was, "This could be an excellent opportunity for you to move. Second thing, "At least you don't own it." Third, "Crap, he kinda likes the place. Hrmm..." I hope all ends well.

This is the top floor, and all the insulation, and the rafters, were dry.
