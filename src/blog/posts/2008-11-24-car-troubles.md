My car won't start, but I have a lot of Thanksgiving travel needs. I think it won't start because the metal strap is insufficiently tight on the negative lead of my car battery. The outside of the nut is so stripped from my struggles to remove it, that it is more like a cylinder than a hexagon. I bought a new nut, a can of WD-40, and locking pliers with a tightening vise screw, and today that finally loosened it. But previous attempts to remove the nut wounded the bolt with deep grooves across the threads. So the nut spins freely to the end of the bolt and gets stuck beyond all my force. I have a ratchet wrench that is deep enough to reach the nut, but the nut is so mis-shapen that none of its attachments fit.

One of these? http://www.autozone.com/selectedZip,85248/initialAction,accessoryProductDetail/initialR,203870/shopping/selectZip.htm If it is, it will take you 15 minutes to cut the old one off the battery cable, strip back the insulation, unscrew the two bolts on the new terminal, insert the stripped wire, and screw it all onto the battery post. Walmart sells them as a pair also in the auto department near the batteries. It's really really easy to fix. I've had to do it a couple times.

The ones in my car are like [this](http://www.autozone.com/R,939386/vehicleId,1957101/initialAction,partProductDetail/store,2769/partType,00170/shopping/partProductDetail.htm). Is it any more difficult? Would the ones you suggested also work?

Looks to be the same technique, just a different design. I would suggest sticking with the model designed for your vehicle to allow the wire to route the way it was designed unless you know the other model would fit. Switching to a different model may offer benefits such as corrusion resistance and prevent issues like this in the future. The nut and plate on the lower left would be where the stripped wire would be clamped. If you need assistance, I may be available. Gmail text me or something and we'll talk about it.

If that's the piece that's messed up, I agree completely. Just cut it off and replace it. Murray's would also have them.

What they said. It should be pretty easy for you and save you $50-$100 at a mechanic. It's not something you can easily mess up unless the cable is so short that it won't reach if you lose that extra inch or so.
