[The SciPhi Show](http://thesciphishow.com/) is a podcast about science fiction and philosophy by Jason Rennie, an anti-abortion creationist who answers science fiction philosophical dilemmas by saying [he has faith in his lord and savior Jesus Christ](http://thesciphishow.com/?p=17).\* Upon originally hearing the name, I thought it would be a podcast exploring futuristic philosophies as illustrated in cutting-edge science fiction. Instead, the episodes I've heard thus far have used any old work of fiction-- often a Hollywood science fiction film or a short work of fantasy literature-- as a "jumping off point" to introduce listeners to the bare existence of basic quandaries of philosophy. In the first few episodes, the host recited the same stale thoughts that have been recycled for centuries, with no reference to the challenges posed by the literature of ideas written in the last ten or twenty years. He appears to have been influenced not by [the Geek Philosophers](http://www.rudyrucker.com/lifebox/), but by the obsolete Greek Philosophers and their spiritual descendents in evangelical Christian apologetics-- William Lane Craig, Alvin Plantinga, and Intelligent Design advocates such as William Dembski, or Michael Behe who disgraced himself on the stand at the Dover Panda Trial. The Sci Phi Show recently interviewed Robert Sawyer, and [you know what I think of his work.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/106722.html) A podcast about science fiction and philosophy from a non-progressive perspective is like having a podcast about how to cook steak, hosted by a vegetarian. I'm not sure how much more of the show I can listen to, since I dread arguing with my radio. It gets me so worked up during a car trip, that I'm distracted from whatever it is I was driving to. When I mentioned my frustration to , she responded as I knew she would: by suggesting that I set up my own podcast. "This time, do the podcast in English, not Lojban," she added. I think I have [enough material](http://www.nemorathwald.com/SFandF.htm) for a podcast for people who sometimes feel like they're from the future, living in a time that isn't ready for them. It would approach futuristic developments in philosophical, religious and political thought as illustrated in the thought experiments of hard science fiction authors such as Greg Egan, Vernor Vinge, John Varley, Karl Schroeder, Rudy Rucker, and many geek philosophers such as [Eliezer Yudkowski](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/134142.html), Ray Kurzweil, or WIRED Magazine editor [Kevin Kelly](http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:9i9WszCFVPMJ:kk.org/writings/nerd_theology.pdf). The question is whether I have enough time to do my podcast about Lojban and do this new one as well. Would you listen to it? \*edited to add: Mr. Rennie also considers homosexuality immoral. He also supports the right of parents to withhold life-saving medical care from their children for religious reasons. The hits just keep on coming.

As I was reading the first two paragraphs, I found myself thinking "You should do a podcast, Matt!" Imagine my glee when I reached the last paragraphs. Yes, I would certainly listen.

To be honest, I probably could tell people how to cook steak, but then, I at least had experience cooking steak before becoming a vegetarian. ;-)

It's not so much that you can't do it; it's a matter of conflict of interest. Examples of this nature could be considered a variant on the "[concern troll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_troll)".

Oh, I agree with this. And while I have chosen to be a vegetarian, I'm not going around being a vegetarian evangelist (not anymore). So, no, I probably shouldn't be seen as an authority on cooking steak (especially since I haven't done it in 20 years), but I'm not going to tell you not to, either. Which probably takes it from conflict of interest, to simply irrelevant. ;-)

To be honest, I'm too impatient to listen to anyone's podcasts. I'd read a blog on the topic, though.

Its a commute thing. I listen to podcasts because I don't like anything on the radio.

I can see that. I don't have much of a commute, and I ride with Lisa, so we tend not to bother listening to anything.

Seconded.

I would definitely listen to Podcasts from you, on a wide range of topics. You are an explorer into a future I find fascinating, and reports from the frontier would be welcome!

I would definitely listen to such a podcast.

Thanks for leaving me a useful and constructive email detailing what you didn't like about the program instead of writing a blog entry whining about it. Oh wait. Jason

Oh and thanks for misrepresenting my position on things. But hey, what do I expect from a "progressive". Anything in service of the cause right ?
