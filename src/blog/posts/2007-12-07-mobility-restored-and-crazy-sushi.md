\> EXIT SECRETARY OF STATE On the way back you decide to stop for lunch on 12 Mile just west of Dequindre in Madison Heights. There, nestled between the Burger King, Tubby's Subs, KFC and Checkers, is a sign reading "CRAZY SUSHI". Not "Status Symbol Sushi". Not "Elegant Sushi". Not even "Over-Educated, Under-Employed Sushi". "CRAZY". In puffy cartoon letters, no less! Not an adjective most sushi-aficionados want to associate with raw fish. Do you feel like finding out for yourself if this fish is, truly, _off the hook_?

\> ENTER CRAZY SUSHI As you enter the one-room establishment, the chef and cashier look up from their work, as if in surprise. Half the size of your flat, this kitchen-and-dining-room-in-one has two major pieces of furniture: a counter with glass display, and a bench-table arrangement. The east wall features a corkboard. The exit is to the north. One of the proprietors, the cashier, greets you; she hands you a menu. > ASK CASHIER ABOUT MENU "What does the chef recommend?" you ask. "It's all good." "Is there a favorite?" "Everyone has different tastes" she says, laughing. > INVENTORY - insurance card - registration card - license plate - menu - money (The Secretary of State has left you with enough for this meal.) > READ MENU Hey, Spicy California Roll for $4.25! > ASK CASHIER FOR SPICY CALIFORNIA ROLL She thanks you and the chef begins. > EXAMINE FURNITURE Counter: All made from lumber (with the ink printing of the lumber store still on it). Bench-table: All made from lumber (with the ink printing of the lumber store still on it). Corkboard: Covered with drawings in colored-pencil, crayons, and chalk, depicting mentally-imbalanced fish. Also a culinary certification. The cashier presents a bag and asks you for $4.25. > GIVE MONEY AND TAKE BAG Money: given. Bag: taken. \*\*\*Checkpoint reached: sushi\*\*\* You go home. The sushi is delicious. Exiting Rachel's car, you attach the insurance card, registration card, and license plate to your car. \*\*\*Checkpoint reached: legal car.\*\*\* You drive your car to the gas station and having checked the car's systems for sedimentation and congealment, you top off the brake fluid, oil, and tire pressure. You also top yourself off with _win_. \*\*\*You have won\*\*\*
