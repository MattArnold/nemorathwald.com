The Universist Movement will host [the famed Professor Richard Dawkins for a live guest discussion](http://universist.org/richarddawkins.htm) at [The Faithless Community](http://faithless.org/) on Sunday March 20th at 4PM Eastern (9PM GMT). Richard Dawkins' first book, _The Selfish Gene_ (1976), in which he invented the concept of "memes," became an immediate international bestseller and was translated into all the major languages. Its sequel, _The Extended Phenotype_, followed in 1982. His other bestsellers include _River Out of Eden_ (1995), _Climbing Mount Improbable_ (1996), and _Unweaving the Rainbow_ (1998). Dawkins won both the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los Angeles Times Literary Prize in 1987 for _The Blind Watchmaker_. The television film of the book, shown in the 'Horizon' series, won the Sci-Tech Prize for the Best Science Program of 1987. He has also won the 1989 Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London and the 1990 Royal Society Michael Faraday Award for the furtherance of the public understanding of science. In 1994 he won the Nakayama Prize for Human Science and in 1995 was awarded an Honorary D.Litt. by the University of St Andrews. Humanist of the Year Award 1996. Since 1996 has been Vice President of the British Humanist Association. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997. Winner of the 1997 (Fifth) International Cosmos Prize in Commemoration of Expo' 90. Recently he spearheaded an effort to introduce the word "bright" into the English language as an atheist analogue to the word "gay." Wired published an excellent biographical article on Dawkins in 1995 ([read](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/dawkins.html)).
