Last night I followed a burning smell to the area of my computers. The Windows box responded when I nudged the mouse, and was in working order, but the screen of the Linux box remained blank. A minute later, there was a brief sound ("fssss") like a sparkler being lit on Independence Day. The power supply still lights up when I turn the computer on, so apparently it's not that component. But the computer doesn't boot.

Heh. Your power supply just sent 110 volts into the mother board and anything else connected to it. That happened to me a few years ago and fried a bunch of circuit boards.

Might want to open it up, and look for burn marks. The Motherboard is still under warantee, but, if the power supply failed, they might be iffy about replacing it. If the power supply failed, you will see wires coming out of it with insulation burned off, Etc.

Oh no... you haven't let out the magic smoke, have you? o\_O (good luck!)

Ok, new rule. In addition to "no meth labs in the basement" rule, add "no campfires in your bedroom." < grin >

You need to order more electrical smoke. Lucas Electric part number 530433. ![](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/TVNews/Misc/ElectricalSmoke.jpg) Order now. It takes a while to get it here from England.

Many cheaply-made motherboards (which is not to say that they weren't expensive to buy) come through our office with exploded power supply filter capacitors. Open up the case and look around the ATX power connector region for blown-up or "bloated" caps. Good news is, these usually don't damage the rest of the hardare. On the other hand, even when they blow up, they usually aren't accompanied by a burning smell, so maybe this isn't it.
