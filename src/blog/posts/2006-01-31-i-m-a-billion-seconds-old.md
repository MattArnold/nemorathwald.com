's dad told her that she'll be a billion seconds old in August. That means I'll be a billion seconds old sometime in February. I would like to calculate when that would be, so that if scheduling permits I can throw a Billionth-Second party this month. I was born at two in the morning on June 17, 1974. Is there a website that will calculate it for me conveniently?

http://www.timeanddate.com/date/birthday.html and if you google "1 billion seconds in years" you get a rough result of 31.689 years.

Thursday, February 23, 2006 is the day on which my one billionth birthsecond falls! OK, now to check with and if it's OK to have a party that day.

Here's a methodology -- number\_of\_days = (2005 - 1974 \* 365) + ((2006 - 1974) / 4) - (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 16) + (31) /\* How many days old are you right now? This gives you the number of days since Jan 1 1974 + plus the number of leap years - the Julian number of days until you were born + the current number of Julian days of the current year \*/ But what you really want is when you'll be a billion seconds, so lets see how many days a billion seconds is: minutes = 1,000,000,000 / 60 = 16,666,666 min 40 secs hours = 16,666,666 / 60 = 277,777 hr 46 min 40 sec days = 277,777 / 24 = 11,574 days 1 hr 46 min 40 sec years = 11,574 / 365 = 31 years, 259 days, 1 hr 46min 40 sec So 259 days from June 17 (Julian date is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 17 = 158) Day offset = 365 - 158 = 207 days Day offset 2 = 259 - 207 = 42 days Your Billion second birthtime = Feb 11th, 2006 at 03:46:40 Someone may want to check my math/assumptions, as I may be a day off, and I don't have time to check my work.

Did that take leap days into account?

Probably not, now that I look at it, but that would shift the date to Feb 3rd, So not sure where the missing 20 days are.

OK, found two math errors -- Remainder days should be 251 (neglected the 8 leap days), and the ofset days should have been 168. That makes the offset into 2006 54 days, which is Feb 23rd. I'm happier now that I found my error. So, that's a Thursday. It should be OK for a party, as long as you don't go too late. Just as long as you don't have the party at 3:46 am.

Corrected algorithm below: But what you really want is when you'll be a billion seconds, so lets see how many days a billion seconds is: minutes = 1,000,000,000 / 60 = 16,666,666 min 40 secs hours = 16,666,666 / 60 = 277,777 hr 46 min 40 sec days = 277,777 / 24 = 11,574 days 1 hr 46 min 40 sec years = (11,574 / 365) - 8 = 31 years, 259 days, 1 hr 46min 40 sec So 259 days from June 17 (Julian date is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 17 = 168) Day offset = 365 - 168 = 197 days Day offset 2 = 251 - 197 = 54 days Your Billion second birthtime = Feb 23rd, 2006 at 03:46:40

[This site](http://www.timeanddate.com/date/duration.html) let me put the start date and the end date in and told me how long it was between them. It agrees with the other site.

All that math stuff makes my head hurt!! LOL

HUH? ? ? ? Oh here comes the math headache! ! !
