I have all but one thing. I have a capsule-toy vending machine to randomly dispense static film window clings, coupons for free t-shirts, free memberships to various Michigan conventions, and so forth. I have fliers. I have a huge box of t-shirts. I have our photo album. I have an unfoldable origami penguin centerpiece. I have foam-core signs on cardboard easels. I have our vinyl banner. I have four boxes of Cafe Penguicon supplies. I have blue painter's tape. I do not have an actual hall table reserved at Capricon. DOH! I have now put in the request to Capricon, at least to be on a waiting list, but their convention starts tomorrow. I hold out very little hope. Given that I cannot afford an actual membership, for a moment there I was not sure what I was going to do with myself for four days in between running Cafe Penguicon. The answer is simple. Volunteer. Volunteer like mad. That's where I'm happiest anyway.

There are people we can talk to. You know people who know people.

Problem solved... there will be a fan table reserved for Penguicon. Dave McCarty is running the tables... he has set one aside for you. There will be a little sign on the table to tell you which one is yours. Any questions, ask for Dave in Ops.

Use our Linux Journal quarter page ad and blow it up to letter size. http://www.zifferent.net/p7/FlyerFullLetter/Penguicon\_Linux\_Journal\_QuarterPage\_Ad.pdf That's all we have in color right now. Thanks!

Do we need to prep signage/art for the room, or is that being brought? If there are art files available, I have access to color output at work, up to 12" x 18". Also, any last-minute supplies you need, e-mail a list to wdonohue(at)gmail(dot)com We will be on site before 1pm Friday, though I think the suite won't be available until 3pm. -- Brian out --

I am making a color PDF poster that I will email to you. Also a supply list. Just to confirm, is the room available to throw a 2-night party, or just one of the nights?

You may want to double check with parties at capricon dot org, but my notes show that Penguicon has the suite both friday and saturday night.

Correct, the suite is for Friday/Saturday. I will be on site around noon Friday. -- Evil Overlord of Coffee out --
