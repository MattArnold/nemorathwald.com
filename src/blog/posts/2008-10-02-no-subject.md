So I dropped off the first thirty or so orders at the local "Goin' Postal: Your Friendly Neighborhood Shipping Center". While I was there filling out international customs forms, I got the casheir to bring up PodDisc.com on his computer and he was really interested, so I hope I have a new customer. Then I drove to this guy's home here in town and hand-delivered his CD. I have a bottle of glue that turns things into removable sticky-notes. I put it on the blank area on the front of a Penguicon business card, and stuck it face-down on the package. On the back of the business card I wrote: "We didn't say anything on the site about same-day delivery, but I like to under-promise and over-deliver. Enjoy! Sincerely, Matt at PodDisc.com." There is an episode of Writing Excuses on there which won't be released for free in their feed for a week, so timeliness matters if they are to have that bonus. I got home to find the number of orders escalated beyond all expectation. That will keep me in coffee beans and ramen. I need to re-order supplies.

I could use some same day delivery. You don't deliver fishnet shirts do you?

Usually not, although I do sell things on eBay that other people donate to me. I'm set up with a postage meter, label printer, and postal scale, I have shelves full of shipping supplies, and I go to the post office most days. I do order fulfillment all the time. So I'm interested in ways to expand that work. But I have no fishnet shirts in stock right now, sorry.
