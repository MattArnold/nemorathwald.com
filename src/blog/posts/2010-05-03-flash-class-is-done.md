Pretty sweet. A small bug I see is that if I hit "next" to go through all the Presentation pics, then if I go back all the way with "previous", I no longer see the intermediate, "burst of empathy" slide. Just figured I'd let you know.

A giant purple bug ate the second slide! Actually the Print section has the same problem. The teacher explained that it is a problem with Flash, and the workaround was too complicated for him to teach this semester.
