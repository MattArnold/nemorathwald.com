Paul, May I ask exactly what you meant by that statement on questioning authority. I'm just curious. Thanks Jared Grover

* * *

Hmmm. . . . . . .I think I know what he meant, maybe. I seem to remember the name "Paul Perdue" mentioned back when I was in PCC. He's the one that QUESTIONED AUTHORITY SO MUCH, that he caused the students to lose EMAIL PRIVILEDGES because he instigated a PCC HATE CLUB (my words) "The Student Voice" through the email system. I didn't have email access again until I was a grad student in my private dorm. So, it seems, any type of authority, whether college or Presidential, is a real problem for him. May I add that yes, I agree there were a lot of rules and sometimes some questionable problems brought down by administration (eg. the Wilds memo) but, as a whole, PCC is a great college with excellent standards to PROTECT the college students while they are there. I remember the "grunge" years. Oh, dear, I think we didn't have presidential perogative that year. Anyhow, could you imagine what kind of testimony for Christ PCC would have been if dress standards were any different? Just like when you work for KFC or a top of the market company, there is a STANDARD for the success of that company, for the display of that company. I'm rambling. I am very thankful for the years I had a PCC. For my friends, for Pastor Schettler and his family with Luke having micropthalmia like me. For Dale who drove me south a few times(: and took me straight to Ambee's!!! For the Gibbs, there are too many to mention that made a big impact on who I am now because the Lord used people like Amber and Dale to influence my life, and my dear Tammy. I had issues too, like how they wanted me to record for the Ensembles, but couldn't have me in Ensemble because of how I looked(long story, but it is true) that hurt. That was hypocritical on certain people's parts, but I wouldn't go to the extent that Paul Perdue did and cause such an uproar that ultimately took a blessing away to MK kids and foreign students who had access for a little period of time to email instead of long distant phone calls, or no phone calls. It was pretty sad what he did. I think the students have email access again now. I hope so. And I hope that another person like Paul Perdue will not make another poor decision to cause the administration to make another harsh decision like they did when I was in college. ~Heidi~

This kid was killed in a war that was launched based on lies, fabrications, and dishonesty. A culture (PCC) that enforces as one of its highest "standards" strict obedience of and not questioning authority would presumably produce citizens who are gullible to such lies, more so, probably, than the average citizen. As such, a death of a member of the community, tragic as it is, may just have the effect of causing a few people to stop and question the things their leaders and authority figures have told them and are continuing to tell them.

\>> I'm rambling. Yeah, you are. From the e-mail you sent, your train of thought obviously has a hard time staying on the tracks. Maybe it's a symptom of your brainwashing. -Matt Arnold, Student Voice member

Melissa, I researched who this Matt Arnold Person was, check this out: http://www.nemorathwald.com/About\_Me.htm And at the bottom, it says this: I am a Bright. I am a member-in-absentia of the Fellowship of Reason. I am a Universist. I am a secular humanist. I am a transhumanist. I am an extropian. I like the Church of Virus and I especially endorse their 6 axioms of epistemology. If you run your cursor over, "Church of Virus" it will say you will go to this website: virus.lucifer.com I did NOT CLICK ON IT. I think someone who is so ANTI-CHRIST, is very dangerous, and should be blocked from our Christian College group, because of our strong Biblical Convictions.

* * *

Heidi, I appreciate your research and thoughts. I am very sorry to hear about the kid that was killed, reguardless of the justice or injustice of war, there is a family that is hurting that we need to remember to pray for. Thanks for letting us know details! As far as blocking people from the group, the policy is that this group is open to all (believer, non-believer, broken, those that appear to have it all together, fundamentals, charismatics, reformed, and I could go on...) as long as the individual is kind and respectful to others (and of course there is to be no pornography or profanity, but that really goes without saying!) I mean, how are we to grow if we are all agreeing with each other and patting each other on the back? Most of my growth (strengthening beliefs I already had or challenge the ones that need changed) has come from people who didn't agree or showed me something different that I wasn't aware of. Plus, isn't that how Jesus lived? I know this may not be the approach of everyone here so, I leave it up to each person to individually decided what they would like to read or not read. Again, Heidi, I am thankful for your input and hope that you will have many more good thoughtful discussions here!!!

Why is he "very dangerous"? Paul

Heidi, "lucifer" in the domain name merely happens to be the last name of the man who runs the webserver that site is on. That Church of Virus website merely discusses how to infect people with ideas through contagious evangelism. I'm not involved with Satan worship. However, at the same time I won't pretend to be a friend of your religion. That's all I feel the need to say here. The "About me" page says it all for those who, for some reason, might be interested. I'm just setting the record straight about your assumption regarding "lucifer." (\*I'm just lucky you didn't also find my web page discussing Jesus or you'd really be shocked.) :) Kindest Personal Regards, -Matt

Matt, I did take some time to read through your material and I am curious as to your vendetta against Christianity. The very notion that you frequent a blog associated with an extreme fundamentalist institution is perplexing. I know you graduated from PCC, but I would assume that you would not want anything to do with other alumni or any discussions with them. Dave

* * *

Dave is right. Why do you, Matt Arnold, and Paul Perdue, who we know from the unfortunate result(loss of email priviledges) of your anger, resentment and utter maliciousness towards PCC, have any contact or association with a Pensacola Christian College blog, message board, or any type of fellowship with PCC alumni/students. And with being so liberal and Anti-Christian, do you want to intermingle with those who do love the Lord? Why? Are you seeking who you may devour??? ~Heidi~

* * *

Dave, Heidi, My siblings are currently students at PCC. I care deeply about their future. I'm on this list, and on the PCCboard forum, mostly to read and keep an eye on what the school is doing in the lives of my loved ones. If I really had a vendetta I'd be contradicting almost everything you say on this list. When I did speak to defend my friend from your inquisition I was quite light-hearted. Haven't you already noticed how quiet I've been until you demanded that I answer for my supposed "agenda"? If this discipline committee is quite satisfied now, I'll go back to just reading again. Until the time comes to "devour" you, I guess. How on earth I would do that I don't know. I've never been forwarded any of the memos from Hell's marching orders yet. Have you failed to send them on to me, Paul? ;^) -Matt
