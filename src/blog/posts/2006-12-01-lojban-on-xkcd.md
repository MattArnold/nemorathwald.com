[![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lojban.png)](http://xkcd.com/c191.html) This work is courtesy of [the XKCD webcomic](http://www.xkcd.com/), and licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) To the man with a hat I could say {jo'a go'ira'o zo'o} -- "That's true for me too. (humorously)" The man without a hat is not entirely correct. In Lojban one can speak as illogically as one wishes to speak. But by pointing that out, I'm exhibiting the sort of detail-oriented pickiness the man with the hat refers to. :) For Lojbanists, [getting xkcd'ed](http://xkcd.com/c191.html) is as good as getting Slashdotted, Dugg or Farked! That means the author of xkcd is expressing a sentiment similar to [Groucho Marx's statement](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx), "I don't care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members." Perhaps we came to his attention from our translation of another one of his comics: [![lo prenu poi roroi ka'e rinka lo nu mi cisma | lo prenu poi ta'e ctuca mi lo cnino ku le munje | lo prenu poi mi djica lo nu mi kansa ke'a ku pu'o mo'u lo pu'u mi jmive | do | la .vaNILa,ais.](http://www.nemorathwald.com/lojban/xkcd/nu_jarco_le_mi_cnisehi.jpg)](http://www.xkcd.com/c112.html) Needless to say, it took no time at all before a Lojbanist translated this comic: ![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lojban_translated.png)

So, is this a good thing?

I consider this an awesome thing. We can definitely laugh at ourselves, and I expect exposure to xkcd's target audience (math, linguistics, and sarcasm) will result in at least one more Lojban enthusiast.

"zo'o"? "Attention! I am going to tell you a joke now!"?

Please.

Yes. It's well-established custom in the Lojban-speaking community to tag a statement as humor if it could otherwise be taken as insult.

So it's not an obligatory morpheme?

No, it's not mandatory to use it. Any Lojban utterance may rely on user interpretation as much as desired. It doesn't usually force a statement to be unambiguous, it merely allows it more thoroughly for those who feel the need to expend the effort to a desired degree of precision.

It's also worth noting that, in reposting the image, you have dropped the title= attribute ("zo'o ta jitfa .i .e'o xu do pendo mi") attached to it in its original home.
