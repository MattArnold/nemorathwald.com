I should frequently repost the comments that I make on interesting OKCupid questions. Today's question: "Would the world be a better place if people with low IQs were not allowed to reproduce?" No. Taking the value of reproductive liberty as a given, there are also more complex and surprising reasons to reject this measure. Suppose one's reason for supporting this measure is to get a smarter population of offspring. Those who know anything about genetics know that is not how it works. All you get is a population that is evolved to be good at rigging the eugenic system. They'll still be dumb in all other respects. The best reason for dumb people not to reproduce is that children are their greatest source of misery (though they're too hopped-up on parent-infatuation hormones to recognize it). But I will defend to the death everyone's right to screw themselves up. Most parents are not dumb, but nearly 100% of dumb people are parents-- depending on whether we define dumbness to include incompetence at family planning. But this illustrates how difficult it is to measurably define intelligence. Often, as in this case, measuring intelligence merely penalizes is people who are different from me, because I'm the one doing the measuring.

I will defend to the death everyone's right to screw themselves up. But do they also have a right to screw up someone else, particularly someone who does not have the option of simply leaving the situation? I'm not talking about smart kids or dumb kids. There's an unbelievable number of incredibly fucked up kids out there due to awful parenting - both from parents being incredibly dumb and from parents being miserable and taking it out on the kids.

That last sentence, especially.

I'm amazed at the number of people I'd consider below-average intelligence who answer that question with "yes" on OKC as well. My answer to that question is also "no." I provide an explanation that there are likely valuable genes mixed in with the genes that produce low-IQ people, and you need to keep the genetic pool diverse. Eugenics is not an exact science; you may be breeding for intelligence and also breed in mental illness or harmful physical traits instead. We've learned that through breeding rapist roosters and pigs that are juicy and lean but mean and lacking mothering skills.
