After listening to the Obama inauguration speech, I rewatched _[Star Trek: Insurrection](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120844/)_ and noticed a serendipitous resonance of themes. The most powerful political entity fears decline, so its leaders violate its founding principles in secret. Individuals take personal responsibility to sacrifice in support of ideals which, while undisputed, had been compromised for expedience. One scene depicts a band of figures, very different from each other, standing shoulder to shoulder on a hilltop in defense of a weak nation not their own. It worked very well with some of the heroic imagery I was reading in the speech transcript. I don't really have a point, I just liked how it worked out. There is [an episode of _The West Wing_ in which Josh tells a staffer not to wear a _Star Trek_ pin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRAmoKtrZg) at work, and she says "Starfleet and the whole Star Trek series is about honor and loyalty and civic duty." He tells her it's fine to be a fan, but don't make it a fetish. Of course he's right, and I don't make it a fetish, but on the other hand, this sort of thing is the reason that maybe it makes sense that Josh also says in the episode that he watches _Star Trek_. By the way, if you're interested, here is [an article about Obama's Sam Seaborn, Jon "Favs" Favreau.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech)

I decided to go to bed at 4 am, yesterday, Inauguration Day. But, the idiot box was on, and as I closed my laptop, I heard West Wing play. I reclosed the laptop three time in the next two hours, because they played the last two epsiodes in a row. I don't want to hope about this President. I've had too many dissapointments in the last few years, and I don't want to feel like that anymore. But I hear that theme song, and I remember feeling good about how the country was going, and having confidence in someone in a position of power. Here's to '09 being the best year of this decade so far.
