[![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cfp73)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cfp73)I have been given a copy of Star Trek:The Next Generation VHS Game. This is your chance to make an offer on it before I put it on eBay. More than just a board game... this interactive adventure actually lets you board the U.S.S. Enterprise and "star" in a special Star Trek: The Next Generation episode! The game is enhanced by a 60-minute VHS videotape that contains original footage shot on location at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood, California. The production uses authentic sets, costumes, special video effects and sound effects from the television show. [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cdhes)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cdhes) Can you play more than once? Absolutely, yes! This VCR format allows you to play again and again - and the game plays differently each time! Each adventure is randomized by the game elements and by the unique interaction and dialogue directly between the players and their video opponent. When the U.S.S. Enterprise is hijacked by a renegade Klingon warrior, you will see, hear, and feel the power of Klingon wrath! Your mission: safeguard the Starship Enterprise and preserve the delicate alliance between the Federation and Klingon Emprire! For everyone, it's a race against the clock! [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cc234)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cc234) Go ahead. Take a Klingon challenge and explore a new and exciting frontier in home entertainment with Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game. [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cee55)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cee55) Contains: One 60-minute VHS tape; 1 game board; 6 tricorders; 6 phasers; 56 computer access cards; 12 holodeck cards; 12 Klingon bIj cards; 6 male playing pieces; 6 female playing pieces; 6 plastic stands; 30 isolinear chips; 6 Federation rank tokens; 4 bridge tokens; 2 stasis fields; 1 die; 1 plastic spinner with base; 1 sticker sheet with 18 communicators; 36 Federation rank pins; 1 spinner sticker; 4 medals of valor; instruction sheet. [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cgs04)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cgs04) Good condition. The box exterior is a little bit scuffed.

There's a [_Men into Space_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052493/) game [too](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13567). Pre-VHS, though.
