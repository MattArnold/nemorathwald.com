Last night Bill Putt and I went to Tio's to talk with Penguicon's committee chairperson Steve G. before the others got there. It's well known that Steve proposed marriage to Dawn in the opening ceremonies of [Penguicon 2004](www.penguicon.org) and she accepted. He'll be too busy planning his wedding this year to run Penguicon 2005 as well. So since Bill and I are totally geeked on Penguicon and have demonstrated skill sets that complement each other, Steve invited us to talk about finding somebody else to be con chair, assistant con chair, or co-con chairs. To skip to the end of the story, I begged off, not from reluctance to help, but simply because the best way I can be of value to the con at this time is to continue doing the program book. But we also agreed to the expanded role I want to bring to that position. This will allow me to increase my involvement and get experience in different departments without putting the convention at risk. Minister of Communications will encompass, among other things: 1. secretary to the programming team, recording their decisions, keeping all documents current and in agreement. 2. receptionist of all miscellaneous e-mails to the website or con chair. 3. co-ordinating the local and web publicity team. 4. publishing the program book and pocket program.

Yay! Congrats to you and Bill. If you guys need an MC for Opening Ceremonies or anything else, I'd love to give you a hand.

I think it's wonderful that you are still on the team and doin everything you possibly can to be involved. I know that I don't want all the commitment myself but I want to help without being so far in charge I get lost you know?

Thanks, Jess. There are some tasks with which we can never have too many helpers!
