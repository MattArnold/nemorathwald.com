My car's starter is malfunctioning again. I tried hitting the solenoid with a wrench like Bill taught me, but it still doesn't start. The electricity is fine, the starter just doesn't engage. It makes no sounds. In the meantime, we have to figure out how to remove a broken-off screw behind the front driver-side wheel of Jen's car. An honest mechanic told us to use a round chisel to bang it out.

If you're hitting the starter with a hammer or equivalent, that probably means that the copper's melted or distorted inside - which means you'll either have to keep hitting it every time or replace it. And the replacing part will inevitably happen.

I wonder if you can get a starter from a salvage yard cheaply to replace the malfunctioning one...
