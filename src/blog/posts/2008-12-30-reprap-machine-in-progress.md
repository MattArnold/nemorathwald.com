My friend Tim from Grand Rapids has been reporting frequently to me about the CNC milling machine that he is building based on the [RepRap](http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/WebHome) self-replicating rapid prototyper project. I gave him some vector art so he can cut pieces for a game I invented that is played on interlocking gears. His machine will probably be portable enough to bring to Penguicon.

> Just wanted to keep you updated... completed assembling my set of RepRap electronics a few days ago. Shimmed up the motor mount spacers, and started wiring up the steppers to the controllers. Here's some pictures of the whole set laid out alongside my OLPC - which I hope to use to control the lot of it, at least just to prove it can be done. A few of the boards pictured aren't necessary for CNC milling - the PWM controller, DC motor controller, and temperature sensor. They're concerned with controlling the thermoplast extruder I have yet to order and build. All that's left is to tighten everything up one last time, and finish wiring the X and Z steppers. I think it will end up a fairly attractive little machine.

Cool. Could he, like, get it to reproduce itself? That we we eventually all could have one.
