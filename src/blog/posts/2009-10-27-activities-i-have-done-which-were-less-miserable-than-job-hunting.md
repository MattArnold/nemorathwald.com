1\. Divorce 2. Funerals 3. Removal of all four wisdom teeth while awake 4. Vasectomy procedure 5. The printer needs the program book but there is no schedule 6. Food service 7. Rambling, delusionally-hostile sermons delivered at jet aircraft decibels 8. Standing for half an hour during an altar call while the pastor and music minister weep and ask why our hearts are so hard 9. [The Creation Museum](http://creationmuseum.org/) In no particular order. I would rather do those things all day every day, than spend my days filling out repetitive application forms and trying to convince a stranger that I am excited and enthusiastic about performing boring tasks that I am unqualified for and secretly dread. But the worst part about it all-- the absolute worst-- is the constant reminder that I know of no realistic career goal I _do_ want to succeed. I have a lot of fulfilling sources of income that bring in a bit here and a bit there, but none that satisfy my responsibilities to pay bills.

I thought you would expand your job as a puppeteer. You are on the leading edge of a great future industry!

Ha ha! Wow, if I knew what steps to take to get a job making or operating puppets, I'd jump at it.
