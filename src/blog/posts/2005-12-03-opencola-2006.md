Bill Putt, Aaron Thul, and the inestimable are here experimenting on a new OpenCola formula and process for Penguicon 4.0. I'll put up the photos and videos soon. has all kind of chemistry and safety equipment which is really photogenic. He has invented [a variant recipe that will taste more like Pepsi.](http://wiki.penguicon.org/OpenCola) We recently gave up looking for last year's box of OpenCola ingredients and were resigned to buying them over again. We were almost out of all of it last year and were going to have to buy more anyway. What we missed the most was our notes of what we had learned. Just now Bill asked if I had a screwdriver, and I went looking for one in the basement. As I came back upstairs, they said "if only we could have found a store that sold coriander oil." I set down a box in front of them and said "there might be some in here." "What is it?" "The OpenCola box. I found it while looking for a screwdriver."

Well, that may not exactly be ironic, but it comes pretty damn close.............I would've heard it from Chuck anyway, but it was worth the laugh to find it out here, first.

I'm sure you know that Amanda is a friend of mine. (She recruited me to work on the 2007 World Horror Convention.)

It doesn't surprise me, but I didn't know. I met Amanda at Midwest Construction. I don't remember if she mentioned it.
