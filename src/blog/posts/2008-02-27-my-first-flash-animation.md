As expected, I took to Flash like a gull takes to the wind. This animation is for use on [my homepage](http://nemorathwald.com/) and serves to explain my domain name. ![](http://nemorathwald.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/nemotrathwaldmatthewarnold.gif)

The flash file of your name is very cool! I like that a lot.

I never knew that was an anagram -- it suddenly makes a lot more sense. A word of caution about flash though. I have noticed that sites which make heavy use of flash are most at risk of being hard to use. This is especially true when the designer makes his own interface "widgets" like buttons and scroll bars, because they no longer behave exactly like the normal ones do. Since I've seen the old versions of your site, I know you won't have the problem I tend to have -- everything is coded nicely but my design is about as interesting as a slice of plain toast.

I turned it into an animated GIF. Don't worry, I don't like Flash technology in the actual browser. I intend to learn it because many employers seek this skill, but for my personal use I intend it to be an animation tool.
