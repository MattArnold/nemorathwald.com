I guess I'll get to experience the pornoscanner and "gate rape"! I would really like to wear the above logo as a t-shirt during that experience. In that spirit, I direct your attention to [these parody lyrics to the tune of "Come Fly With Me"](http://iowahawk.typepad.com/iowahawk/2010/11/comply-with-me.html). Sample:

> Comply with me, you domestic coach class bums If you opt out I'll just give a shout To my icy-handed chums Comply with me, bend over here it comes

For the record, traveling in first doesn't exempt you from this bullshit.

You're coming out to the bay area? Awesome. If you have any time free can I treat you to a meal while you're here? I just re-read and saw you're driving...! If you have room in your trunk and are able to portage an an air compressor from Redford to California, I'd happily pay some toward your travel expenses. Moving or not, the offer for the meal stands strong. What are you doing out in Silicon Valley?

I'm helping a friend move. I plan to arrive Sunday and leave Wednesday. I'll take you up on your offer. Email me with the size of the air compressor and its source and destination.
