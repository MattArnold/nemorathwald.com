I have higher Google PageRank than any other Matt Arnold on the web except for the fictional character in ["Big Trouble"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trouble_%28film%29). Ironically, by linking to this, I'm exacerbating the situation. Surfing the search results far enough, you will come to [a piece of amateur avante-garde experimental music](http://www.archive.org/details/20k076) with a title that happens to contain my name. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: ["Disaster In Matt Arnold's Pants](http://www.archive.org/download/20k076/mc-iedh-02-disaster-in-matt-arnolds-pants.MP3)" by MC Iedh.

The Matt Arnold in the title was the electronic musician who goes by the name "Mr. Projectile".
