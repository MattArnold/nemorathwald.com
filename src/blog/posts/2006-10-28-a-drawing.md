The website for [ConVersation](http://www.con-versation.com) needs new art. I got a good start on it today by drawing . ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/chuckchild.jpg) Earlier, I also earned $100 in two and a half hours of freelance graphic work. It's been a good day for art.

Didn't know you contracted for digital art. If I need somebody to do web graphic work, can I tap you? My artistic skills are fairly pathetic, and I'd rather hone my development skills anyway.

Even after I gave a hint about what it costs? Sure!

_I also earned $100 in two and a half hours of freelance graphic work._ That's \*cheap\* in the corporate world. Don't undervalue yourself, you're worth quite a lot!

Thanks for the wonderful depiction. :-) Seems like certain folks in fandom tend to do pretty good business contracting out their talents on occasion. I wonder if they would all fit into one strangely eclectic side-business?

Interesting style. I think I know what you're up to and I like it.
