Many of you stuck with Firefox for its add-ons, rather than switch to Google Chrome. [Chrome extensions are now here](https://chrome.google.com/extensions), including [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom), [Better Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gmfocnipihcoejdieiimhiecclokidea), [Mini Google Maps](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeahddlmhbcabnnojadgimmiaaplfpfo#), [tab handlers](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/galfofdpepkcahkfobimileafiobdplb), download managers, [synchronizing bookmarks among all your computers](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla), notifiers for GMail, Google Reader, Google Voice, and Google Wave, and [one that notifies of all four of them at the same time](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cfkohgkpafhkpdcnfadadcibfboapggi). Mozilla and Firefox have always had a special place in my heart for what was achieved against the horrors of Internet Explorer. Ironically, it pains me that there is now competition in high-quality open-source web browsers. But I switched to Google Chrome long ago because it showed how low a standard Internet Explorer had set for Firefox to surpass. You thought Netscape Navigator had an awful, cluttered user interface? Chrome actually made the amazing cleanliness and user-friendliness of Firefox look a little like Netscape Navigator by comparison. Chrome is what browser usability, security, speed, memory efficiency, and crash recovery should be. Now, with extensions, there are probably Mozilla employees struggling with their desire to switch to Chrome. The Firefox developers are like heroes to me, so thinking about this makes me sad.

If Chrome gets an equivalent of FB Purity, I'll try it.

Wow. The Facebook Purity user script looks awesome. After writing this LJ post, I looked into the status of Greasemonkey for Chrome. (Greasemonkey is what runs user scripts such as FB Purity on Firefox.) Apparently there is an extension in the works to run user scripts on Chrome. Currently you can only do it with a difficult tweak in the developer version of Chrome. Once that extension is ready, I'm guessing every user script ever written will run on Chrome, including FB Purity.

The biggest reason I don't switch yet is because Chrome doesn't have the developer tools base yet...including my two newest extensions, POW (a web server that can run from your browser) and (allows running Python from Firefox, including add-ons written in Python). Yes, I'm working on a way to serve CREM from Firefox. :D I'll just have to wait for Chrome to catch up...

I don't switch to Google Anything, because I don't trust them to flush their collective memory. I don't think Mozilla has a huge memory array somewhere watching everything their users do; I'm fairly certain that Google does have such an array. Google is probably unintentionally forming the backbone for a system that makes Orwell's TV-That-Watches-Back seem downright benign. So, sorry, not moving to Google anytime soon.

Now that they have AdBlock (and if it works as well as AdBlock Plus from firefox) then all that's holding me back is a lack of ability to make my delicious bookmarks appear in the bookmark bar easily
