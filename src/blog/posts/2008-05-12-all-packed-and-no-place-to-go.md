I was all packed to move to Novi tonight, but Bahb called today to tell me they've decided not to get another roommate. Keep an eye out for opportunities for me. I'm not going to unpack any more than I need to.

I'm sorry things didn't work out for you. I'll keep an eye out.

That is horrible. Something you could have been told YESTERDAY!!! Will be looking out for you for sure.

That's nuts, telling you that at the last minute. What the hell?

Yeah, ditto that.

Well it was kind of rushed. Also the armed forces weren't going to keep the airplane waiting on the runway for Mike, so it wasn't convenient for them.

I'm confused. What does that have to do with them not telling you yesterday? Or several days ago? Or just it wasn't convenient for them to do the moving thing today, so they decided not to do it at all? Weird.

I don't understand the context here. I'm tempted to say that you dodged a bullet, since I wouldn't want to have roommates so flaky they'd pull something like that at the last minute.

What I mean is, it was hardly more than a week ago that I suggested the idea, and maybe it was kind of sudden for them. The second thing is that maybe the timing was awkward for them, what with Mike leaving to be in the military for a year and that made it a really busy environment. So that timing could make it difficult for them to find time to consult each other fully in private about it, or tell me about it in a way they perhaps would have preferred. I don't want to rush to conclusions in a vacuum of knowledge.

I don't think they were aware that the move was as urgen as it was, or that it would have occured so suddenly. Mike mentioned that it might be happening, once he left. And Bahb said that they hadn't even told Karen yet. That was Saturday night. I'm sure that when they knew what was going to happen, they called.

I'm certainly not angry about it. I'm just disappointed, in the way one does not blame anyone for the rain but is disappointed about a rained-out parade.

How do you feel about Florida?

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on May. 14, 2008 10:25 PM

I have several feelings about Florida. It's a second home, where I traveled once a year throughout my childhood. I went to college there. The convention I'm chair of is not there.
