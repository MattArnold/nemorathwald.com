Adults shamed a girl into taking her own life because she texted a photo of her breasts to a teenage boy. Are those adults someone who I would want to have in my life? No. Do they have part of the blame? Yes. Do they deserve scorn and condemnation? Yes. Should they visit her grave in penitence? Yes. Did they **kill her**? **NO.** [This](http://sylviasproblem.wordpress.com/2009/12/02/what-happened-to-hope-witsell/) is so frustrating, it makes me ashamed to be a liberal. Since moral panic led to this, it does not help to add moral panic in reverse. Hope Witsell is to blame for hanging herself, not because she showed a boy her breasts, but because _she hanged herself_. Nobody likes you? I've been there. What you need to realize is that nobody who is in your life right now _matters_. Fuck your parents, fuck your teachers, fuck your peers. That was all an accident of birth. Soon you'll get a new life with people who you choose, who are not worthless. In the meantime you can dull the pain by choosing to stop placing value on them. And that's what your supporters should do with you, to dull the pain now.

It will probably be very welcome in a while when you start getting the hoards of "how dare you" folks. For what it's worth, I couldn't agree more and I couldn't express the sentiment more succinctly than you did. I am weary of people confusing bullying with murder when the recipient of the bullying commits a desperate act to escape it. Tragic, it shouldn't happen, certainly they share responsibility for the results, but it's not the bully (bullies in this case) that did the killing.

Your greatly appreciated logic and reason are the reasons why I you're a valued correspondent on my f'list. However, I am not going to hug you.

I might disagree with your assertion that no one in your life right now matters, as it has been my experience that everyone in your life matters, to some extent, even years after they are no longer a part of your life. They helped to create who you are, today. Having said that, I have to agree that Hope Witsell made a poor choice, in hanging herself, and while I cannot condone her choice, 'tis still her choice to have made. This does not absolve anyone of their responsibility for the consequences of their actions. I only hope that these consequences will give them pause to think, in the future, though I tend to doubt that will be the case.
