Usually, professional services bill by the hour, so I'd estimate how long it will take you to do, and then decide on an hourly rate.

Time-tracking software has proven my suspicion that it takes an unpredictable amount of time each time I do the same creative task.

So much missing information, I don't know where to start. Is it a custom logo or some bog standard, clip-art derived product? My reasoning is the logo will be the hardest part and everything else will be a derivative. A custom, purely original logo can take quite a bit to hammer down, and most small firms don't have the bankroll to fund it. A smaller organization would be happier with something cheap and easy. All that said the fees could range from $3000 to $30000 depending on the amount of customization the client requires.

The client and I had a further conversation today in which he said it would be an iPhone app icon. He has $75 to offer.
