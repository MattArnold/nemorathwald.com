I am considering acquiring the domain scalyanteater.com. I would make Scaly Anteater a company name, for illustration, design, and websites. Alternately, I could just make it mattarnoldworks.com. Less catchy and memorable, and the business card would not be much fun, but it's more straightforward. I realized a moment too late that I should have pointed out a checked box means "good enough" and unchecked means "unacceptable". \[[Poll #1440679](http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=1440679)\]

I know you don't place much stock in my opinions, but an anteater curled in a ball. Swallowing it's tail as it were, or even the circle representing an all encompassing whole. It's better symbolism and I'm of the belief that simple shapes, or repetition of simple shapes make the best logos. Not bad though. I like the tongue.

I like the ball idea...not because of symbolism, but visual proportions and ease of integrating into thumbnails, favicons, business cards, etc. What do you think, Matt? And yes, the tongue is cute. :P

Whichever you decide on, Joe does domain registrations, so check with him if you'd like to deal with someone you know. :-)
