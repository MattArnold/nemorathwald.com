I have finished episode three of jbocradi, Lojban Radio, and it's up on the web now. [Click here to visit the jbocradi website,](http://www.nemorathwald.com/jbocradi/jbocradi.html) where it can be downloaded in MP3 and OGG audio formats and subscribed with RSS or Atom feeds. This episode features part one of "Robin Lee Powell's Tale of Woe," told in Lojban live and in person at Logfest 2003. After that segment, I played the karaoke track to Fredo Viola's "Moon After Berceuse", and sung Lojban lyrics to it. Thanks for the music goes to [Tripp Bratton](http://www.nemorathwald.com/jbocradi/jbocradi.html) for the opening piece, to [the Precursors project](http://www.medievalfuture.com/precursors/) for the theme of Robin's Tale of Woe, and to [Fredo Viola](http://www.fredoviola.com/) for "Moon After Berceuse".

Hi there, Matt I accidentally came upon your use of my music, which, by the way, is a remix of a song I wrote (and copyrighted, ahem...) by my friend LowliFi. Could you please email me? I don't see an email address here. The song is copyrighted, and while I am definitely all about folks being interactive and creative, I would have appreciated you asking me first. Again, please email me: fredo@aviola.com Thanks man. best, Fredo Viola
