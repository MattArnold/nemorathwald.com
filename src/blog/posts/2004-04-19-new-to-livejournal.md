At Penguicon 2.0 this weekend, I attended the LiveJournal meetup, where I learned that LiveJournal's become open to all -- I can now stop hassling people to let me in on the blogging phenomenon. However, one of the advantages one used to have when it was necessary to be invited onto LiveJournal by a friend, was that you instantly had somebody on your friends list. I was surprised that almost all bloggers seem to hide their identity, so that I have to infer from scattered details in their recent history as to which of them I might know. But hey, I guess it's not supposed to be Friendster, right? I'll wait and see what this turns out to be good for. Penguicon was a blast. I just got into fandom at the first Penguicon, a year ago, and now here I am on staff publishing the Program Book and the daily convention newsletters, making flyers and posters, moderating three panels, and performing as Brad in a live performance of Rocky Horror Picture Show. I signed up to run a game of Transhuman Space but I had to cancel several days ago as it dawned on my how overbooked I was! And although it broke my heart to do so, it's a good thing I canceled it or I wouldn't have got anything done. This year I invited two people to their first convention, my eighteen-year-old brother Andy and my ex-wife. (I hate referring to Rachel as "my ex-wife," it sounds so... adversarial. But what label applies? Who knows.) They had a blast. I knew Andy would, but Rachel? Will wonders never cease. She really got into the spirit of it and enjoyed herself, and many of the attendees enjoyed her company too. I'm proud of her.
