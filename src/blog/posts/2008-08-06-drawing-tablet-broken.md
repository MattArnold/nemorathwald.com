I have a little Adesso CyberTablet 6400 pressure-sensitive drawing pad. It was within my price range on eBay all those years ago when I bought it. It's supposedly a poor substitute for Graphire by Wacom, but I don't care. Is there seriously a perceptible difference between 512 and 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity to justify paying $100 $230 instead of $50 $60? Last night it started working wrongly. Instead of clicking when I press the tip to the pad, it starts clicking when I press and release the side switch, and it won't stop clicking until I hold down the switch again. The next comics aren't about me or anybody I know, but they have actual long-term storylines. They're going to be awesome. But for now, no more drawings. Anybody got a tablet that they don't use? 6PM, Edited to add: Now it doesn't recognize the existence of the pen at all. The tablet just blinks its light.

Matt, Are you using the tablet on Windows, Mac, or Linux? Have you changed anything with the computer it is attached to before the time of the malfunction? Is there software that is used to configure the tablet/pen? have any of those settings changed if there is software? Have you tried seeing if there is an update available for the software for the tablet to see if that fixes the problem? Just trying to help you find the cause of the malfunction. Let me know if you want some help getting it working again, it sounds to me like a software problem and not a problem with the hardware itself. -Ron

My successful use of the tablet has been on the Mac Mini. Last week I downloaded the Mac OSX driver [here](http://www.adesso.com/tablet_drivers.asp) and it worked fine without opening up the settings. Last night I tried plugging it into my laptop running Ubuntu Linux Hardy Heron. That was the first time I experienced the problems I described. Today I plugged it back into the Mac Mini, and the same problems carried over. I opened the settings control panel that came with the driver, and tried making every available option in every feature it offered, with no effect.

More troubleshooting... Is there a battery in the stylus?

Yes. Also, I tried changing it for a brand new one, without effect.

There's cheap serial port tablets on eBay. Won't help you on the Mac much, but there's cheap ADB ones too.

In order to work on any computer that can run Adobe Creative Suite, my options are USB and possibly Firewire. Plus I've run out of money with which to pay for rent and food.

if ( you'd like to try an Intuos &&

you can wait until Tuesday &&

you still need a tabled Tuesday &&

you can get an agent of yours to pick it up from Tios &&

you can get it returned to Tios at an agreed date (I don't go there often))

{

I have an Intuos 6x11 you're welcome to borrow for a few weeks;
