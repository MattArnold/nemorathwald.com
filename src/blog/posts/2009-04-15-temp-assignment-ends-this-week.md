Friday will be my last day at the temp job in the Mount Clemens area. They hold out the possibility of bringing me back in the very short-term future. That will depend whether the other assignment in Ann Arbor is still waiting for me. I'm glad to have the chance to focus on my final exam in Intro to Java on May 4. I think there's something else I've got to do on the three days preceding it. What was it ... ? Oh yes, the [incandescent culmination](http://penguicon.org/whatisit.php) of eighteen months of work. When I was steadily employed, this time of year was when I took vacation days. This year we've managed to add panels about podcasting, interactive fiction, Lojban, even polyamory. So you can naturally see why I'm so excited. I think we may have broken our record for most events in a single weekend, but we'll have to see. Naturally when we sent out the [individual itineraries](http://penguicon.dabbledb.com/publish/penguicon2009schedule/09db092d-9d3a-4ef3-bdaf-747595751345/eventsbyparticipant.html?embed=true) to every program participant, we caught a bunch of corrections. That's good-- it means we're catching them _before_ the weekend. This year I put together a staff who by and large want to work hard, not procrastinate, and therefore have less stress.
