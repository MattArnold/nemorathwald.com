Your Aspie score: 149 of 200 Your neurotypical (non-autistic) score: 61 of 200 You are very likely an Aspie ![](http://www.rdos.net/eng/quizpoly.php?p1=74&p2=34&p3=74&p4=82&p5=31&p6=22&p7=69&p8=24&p9=72) What kind of terrible social sciences major am I that I didn't know what AS was? I recognized everything else associated with it though (even if I take a psychoanalytic case-by-case approach rather than a "let's throw drugs at it and hope it goes away!" stance).
