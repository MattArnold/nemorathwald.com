There are only a few hours before the Thursday night dinner for concom and Guests of Honor of [Penguicon.](http://www.penguicon.org) I'm excited! I've confirmed that the [Chaos Toy](http://www.chaostoy.com/main.html) and [program book](http://wiki.penguicon.org/ProgramBook) have been delivered to the hotel. The pocket program awaits me at a nearby Kinko's. Then I need to buy a bow tie at the mall next door. Sadly, due to a last-minute schedule change the Looneys won't arrive until tomorrow. This means I have more time to think of an idea of a gift to give them.
