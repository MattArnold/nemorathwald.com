Good news! If you support alternative treatments over medicine, there is a good chance you did not contribute to the death of Steve Jobs. That was lousy. Let me start over. The role played by alternative treatments in the death of Steve Jobs has been over-emphasized, and [is completely uncertain](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/10/steve_jobs_neuroendocrine_tumors_and_alt.php?utm_source=networkbanner&utm_medium=link). In 2003, Steve Jobs chose to attempt to treat his cancer with a special diet, and changed his mind after nine months. We actually have no idea whether the following six or seven years of aggressive medical treatment would have been prolonged his life any longer, if begun nine months earlier. With some cancers, unquestionably yes. With this form... unknown.
