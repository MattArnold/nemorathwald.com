In the [jboselkei game](http://chain.lojban.org/jsk/), someone translated "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" as {le te frigau be lei drata prenu bei ko cu simsa le seldji be do be'o te frigau be do bei lei drata prenu}. I am going to be amazed if we can't do better than that! The [Lojban babelfish](http://www.lojban.org/jboski/) auto-translates it as follows: \[1(2\[simsa1 (**similar thing(s)**) **:**\] le **the** {3te frigau **experienced thing(s)** be (4\[frigau2 (**experience-r(s)**) **:**\] lei **between them the** (5drata **different \[type-of\]** prenu **person(s)**)5)4 bei **and** (6\[frigau1 (**thing(s) bring-ing about experienc-ing**) **:**\] ko **YOU!**)6}3)2 cu **is/does** «7simsa **being similar**»7 (8\[simsa2 (**similarity reference(s)**) **:**\] le **the** (9{10seldji **desired** be (11\[seldji2 (**desire-r(s)**) **:**\] do **you**)11 be'o}10 \[**type-of**\] {12te frigau **experienced thing(s)** be (13\[frigau2 (**experience-r(s)**) **:**\] do **you**)13 bei **and** (14\[frigau1 (**thing(s) bring-ing about experienc-ing**) **:**\] lei **between them the** (15drata **different** \[**type-of**\] prenu **person(s)**)15)14}12)9)8\]1 That loses something in the translation. Someone also translated "This may be your last chance" as {ju'o cu'i do ca ro re'u nu'o co'e}. This is elegantly imaginative and minimalist, and means exactly what it should mean, but _there is not even one root word in the entire sentence._ Only interjections, tenses, pronouns, and truth aspects. It is imaginatively Lojbanic, taking advantage of the language's peculiarities, because none of the words mean "this", "may", "be", "your", "last", or "chance." I'm impressed. I found out both sentences were translated by the same person. Why is it that the translation of the Golden Rule appears to attempt to take vast amounts of information implied in the English and make it explicit? The translation of "last chance" artfully embeds all that implicit information in the ellipsis word "co'e".

Curious: How would you translate "Just enough isn't"? I have a sign I made on a wall at work with that phrase.

That will be my post to jboselkei for today. Let's see if a consensus is reached.

The anonymous comment was me. There's a numeric digit in Lojban, {rau}, which means "enough." No one else has translated your sentence in the game yet, but I would translate it as: li rau na banzu (The number "enough" is not sufficient.)
