The Devil from the [Sinfest](http://www.livejournal.com/users/sinfestfeed/) online comic strip (yeah, that dapper guy who serves as my perpetual messageboard icon) has retired from his diabolical job in the storyline of the cartoon. He now dresses in a T-shirt and shorts. I too have recently dabbled in the Punk Side. At the panel on Cyber-Age Mythology at Penguicon, I wore a black suit, but in place of a white button-down shirt and black tie, I wore a greyish-blue T-shirt. I had just returned from a failed attempt to dress in a "Men In Black" hall costume which everyone mistook for hotel staff. I was told afterward I looked like clergy. That's fine with me. Although that might explain why the only people who usually express interest in me are gay guys. ;^) But there are over-riding priorities. When sitting in the audience in a panel on some cutting-edge philosophical topic, and I raise my hand, I want a moderator to say, "I'll call on that eloquent and thoughtful gentleman," not "he looks like a grunge rocker." Being listened to and taken seriously is more important than hitting on chicks. In fact, even supposing (as my friend Blasted Bill suggests) it reduces the quantity of dates, I argue that at least it increases their quality. So I told Blasted Bill, as he tried in vain to get me to dress in T-shirts and shorts, "if a woman wants that, she wants somebody else." As Sinfest would say, "Truth in advertising, baby! BOOYAH!"
