We'll have at least two [SMOS Dinners](http://penguicon.org/faq.php#smos) between now and Penguicon. Allison Anderson will host at her home in New Baltimore on Friday, March 14. Limey Zernich will host at his home downriver on Friday, March 28, where we will test out Penguicon's new Chaos Machine. Both will be at 7 PM. Email me at my gmail account, matt dot mattarn, for directions.

Matt... what's the last "s" in smos stand for? We used to call these SMOP dinners at one point, and of course I know SMOF... but what's the final "s" in SMOS?
