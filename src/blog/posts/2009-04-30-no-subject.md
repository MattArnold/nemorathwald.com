Dropped off my car full of stuff at the hotel, drove to Lathrup Village to pick up and pay for the program books and pocket programs. Returned to the hotel. Taking inventory. Normally no one is in charge of making sure the stuff from the cube gets to someone who needs it. So in the past most of it just sat in Ops, and after the convention, people were astonished to discover it existed and could have met their needs. This year I have made it my job to do it.
