Now half the keys on my only USB keyboard have stopped working. So, although I have a tablet for the Mac, I don't have a keyboard. All I need is a humble commodity USB keyboard; I can get one for $6 plus shipping on Newegg.com, but I would be amazed if no one I know has one sitting around that they don't care about anymore. Anyone have one they'd part with at garage-sale prices?

I can hook you up with one at no charge (I have lots). I am, of course, here in Ann Arbor.

Thanks! I plan to attend the Ann Arbor Gaming Group tonight. Currently I don't know where it will be located except that it will be at a coffee shop. Could you email me your phone number, and possibly drop a keyboard off?

Sure...I'll email you the number. What is the Ann Arbor Gaming Group?

A bunch of gamers and game designers who live in or around Ann Arbor or want to meet with those who do. There are some game publishers who are known to attend.

My ride fell through. By the way, can you retry sending the email? I would have phoned you, but never got your number.

You can pick one up for under $10 at the computer store at 14 mile and 75. . . .But I don't have one right now.
