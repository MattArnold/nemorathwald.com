The symptoms my computer has been experiencing match the description of the [Sasser worm](http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/sasser.asp). I could follow the instructions for deleting it, but I plan to format my hard drive and reinstall my software anyway, since that should save a lot of disk space and improve performance on top of killing the worm. I'd better carve out time to do it soon. Lots of work to do already for the websites of [ConFusion](http://stilyagi.org/cons/2005/) and [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org).

What are going to work on for the [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org) website?

I was just about to e-mail you about it. Mostly it's pruning to correct any obsolete info or put future tense in past tense. I'm impressed by how much of that has already been done! Did you do that? Another thing will be taking over updating the media reports, and Steve is sending me a web search-engine preset he's created for that. I need access to all the admin functions so that I can select the "hide" feature that Steve told me about last night. He said when a piece of content is hidden it still exists; for instance, if I hide the info about 2004 hotel arrangements, I can just uncheck the "hide" checkbox later if we decide to stay at the same hotel next year. Currently when I go to "List Pages," it just says "no items for the current list." Then, I need to re-do the masthead image to give it the MacType font with a clearer background shadow. I'll send you that image when it's ready. Then, I need info at penguicon d0t org and chair at penguicon d0t org re-directed to me. (Bill wants me to be his e-mail gatekeeper.) There are several committee positions that still haven't been filled, and until they are they need to come to me temporarily: ops, artshow, hotel liason and consuite. Treasurer will need to remain the same for the immediate future. Also the suggestion box should be redirected to send the suggestions to me. Thanks a lot!
