My ethernet switch just burned out. I've got to switch an ethernet cable between computers to do my shipping now. Has somebody local got a spare ethernet switch sitting around that they don't want? If you'd be willing to part with it, I'd appreciate it. Newegg has one for $13, so I'd be willing to pay $7 for yours if you don't want to just give it away.

Will a hub do?

Yeah, that would be fine. I'd need at least 5 ports on it.

Yes. Yours if you want it.
