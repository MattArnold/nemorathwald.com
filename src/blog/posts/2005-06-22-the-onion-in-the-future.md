Not only is this week's issue of _The Onion_ set in the future, [the horoscopes page](http://www.theonion.com/2056-06-22/horoscope/) satirizes major science fiction creators and influences. Hilarious!

The Asimov/Clarke one brought to mind the "Technomage" episode of B5, second season. Yes, I'm a sci-fi dork.
