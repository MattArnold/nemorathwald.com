What if plane fare money was no object for a science fiction convention? What if I could bring _every single one_ of the most interesting Geek Philosophers on the entire internet, no matter how obscure outside their fields? What if I could talk to every visionary on the planet who fascinated me and provoked thoughts that kept me awake at night? What **dream team** would I put together? That is [my forthcoming podcast.](http://suspension-of-belief.blogspot.com/) The first episode will be a metacast about what the podcast will be about. The second episode will be an interview with Ron Hale-Evans, author of the O'Reilly book "Mind Performance Hacks." The third episode will be an interview with uber-transhumanist extraordinaire Anders Sandberg, Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Philosophy Faculty of Oxford University. Anders is one of the few humans I have ever heard of who comes close to possessing a distributed exocortex. Before I launch the podcast, I'm building a buffer of episodes to cover me during the inevitable busy times. I'm going to leave the rest of my guest lineup as surprises. I have a very, very large rolodex. I think half the people on it are excited and think this idea is long overdue! I'm getting unsolicited emails reading "count me in!" By the way, this podcast inherited the name "Suspension Of Belief" from my existing Science Fiction and Futurics page. I am not married to it, but would be interested in suggestions. The next time you hear me talking about starting a webcomic, remind me I would be too busy.

_What if I could bring every single one of the most interesting Geek Philosophers on the entire internet, no matter how obscure outside their fields?_ Watch out for alienating people, however. If you say (or imply) that these are The Great People, those that didn't make the list but think they should have could feel slighted. It's a cool idea though. :)

\*shrug\* Then the list would exist implicitly rather than explicitly. Some people won't be asked on the show for innocent reasons having nothing to do with whether they deserve to be on it. Maybe I haven't found them yet. Maybe I think they're too busy. Maybe I think they're already overexposed and want to give more obscure ones some attention. Maybe I have no clue how to contact them. And so on. If your hypothetical people read such a statement of intent, they should interpret it to mean I want to talk to them. Otherwise nothing I say or don't say would prevent them from being offended. By the way, I'm glad you mentioned alienating people. It's regrettable to alienate listeners, and it's nice to avoid it if reasonable to do so. However, I decided one of the founding principles of the podcast will be that if one's goal is to avoid alienating listeners, talking about philosophy is a bad strategy to achieve that. So it will just have to be worked around.

I, for one, am offended!

_However, I decided one of the founding principles of the podcast will be that if one's goal is to avoid alienating listeners, talking about philosophy is a bad strategy to achieve that._ Laugh. This is true. "Eat me, beat me, jack me, jerk me. [TALK HARD](http://www.mycal.net/old/projects/mpr/hardhar.htm)." Enjoy, Matt. :)
