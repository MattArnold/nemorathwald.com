Here's a photo taken at yesterday's Kerrytown Book Fair in Ann Arbor by SF/Fantasy author [Tobias Buckell](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/wordpress/?p=2327): ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/penguicon/kerrytownsfauthors.jpg) The only thing I knew about the event in advance was that [John Scalzi](http://www.scalzi.com/), [Sarah Zettel](http://www.sff.net/people/sarah-zettel/), [Anne Harris](http://www.lib.msu.edu/vincent/writers/spring03/021403.htm) and [Tobias Buckell](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/wordpress/?p=2327) were giving a panel on science fiction. Since their business is not bookbinding, I expected the Book Fair to have more to do with "book" meaning "text content" than "book" meaning "sandwich made of paper and flavored with ink". I was surprised to learn this was not so. There was precious little original content being promoted, and woe betide the person who talks about e-books.

No thanks, I prefer real food to simulated. Preferably, as close to real food as possible.
