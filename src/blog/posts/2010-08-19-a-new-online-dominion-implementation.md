[dominion.isotropic.org](http://dominion.isotropic.org/) is a new place to play the card game Dominion online. It's a fast-loading text interface. Unlike the German site [Brettspeilwelt.de](http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en) ("BoardGameWorld"), isotropic implements _all_ the cards (except Black Market and Stash, because... I'm not sure how they would even do that). If you don't like finding your way around the Flash interface of Brettspielwelt, and if you just want to jump into a game of Dominion, and if you don't mind the lack of pretty pictures, and if you try when the site's not at it's fifty-user maximum, dominion.isotropic.org is for you.
