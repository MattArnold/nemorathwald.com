OK, I think I'll participate in this activity that's going around LJ. You can ask me any question, by posting a comment to this journal entry anonymously or otherwise. But I don't promise to answer it. I'll only answer it if I feel like it. Or it might be, "I don't know." All comments will be screened, so they won't appear unless I answer them, and questioners won't be named. For instance, you could ask me if [Wikipedia has a webpage about intrinsically funny words.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherently_funny_word) Or you could ask what [software will run from a USB flash drive without requiring an install.](http://combobulate.com/usbutils.htm) Come to think of it, you might want to [Ask Dr. Science](http://www.drscience.com/quest/today.htm) instead. "There is a thin line between ignorance and arrogance," he says, "and only I have managed to erase that line."

Hummming....Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
