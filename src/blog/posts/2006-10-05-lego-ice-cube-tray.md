![](http://cache.lego.com/images/shop/prod/4277645-0000-xx-12-1.jpg)The [NOTCOT](http://www.notcot.com/archives/2006/10/lego_cocktail_p.html) design blog clued me in to [this tray that makes ice cubes shaped like LEGO bricks](http://shop.lego.com/product.asp?p=4277645&cn=158&t=7&d=21). LEGOs convey the hacking spirit. If only this were sold in our country, it would be a great addition to [OpenCola](http://www.penguicon.org/wiki/OpenCola)!

If you want some, my sister lives in England (as do many friends) and I can easily get them shipped over.
