Wow! I just answered the door in my bathrobe to find three police officers. A neighbor saw me pull in and thought they heard me kick in the door. I don't mind. I'm glad to know the police are responsive in case someone does try to kick in the door.

Did you have trouble opening the door, or what?

No; it went normally. I don't remember any kind of loud noise, either.

I realized what happened. My trunk doesn't latch unless I slam it three or four times. That must have sounded like kicking in the door.
