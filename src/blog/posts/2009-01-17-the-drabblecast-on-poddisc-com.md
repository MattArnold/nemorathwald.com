![](http://static1.shopify.com/s/files/1/0013/8682/products/Drabblecast-set_large_large.jpg?1232025758) I am proud to add "[The Drabblecast](http://web.me.com/normsherman/Site/Podcast/Podcast.html)" to what I sell on [PodDisc.com](http://poddisc.com)! Strange stories, by strange authors, for strange listeners … such as yourself. Each episode of The Drabblecast presents a Drabble (a story exactly 100 words long) and follows it with a short story with music and audio effects second to none. Many Drabblecast stories are from some of today’s most distinguished authors, who want to find a place to publish fun stories they have written about Orca whales with laser guns on their heads. The host Norm Sherman and editors Kendall Marchman and Luke Coddington also air high-quality material submitted by audience members who are talented but unknown. The Drabblecast aims to present stories too eccentric, disturbing, funny, and downright fun for more dignified genre publications. Norm frequently presents news about nature’s strangest animals, and concludes some episodes with a “Bbardle”, a comedy song written by the request of a donor. The Drabblecast has earned a large and enthusiastic community of listeners.
