This weekend at ConFusion I was the Guest of Honor Liaison to PZ Myers, the evolutionary neurobiologist whose blog [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/) is one of the best science blogs out there. We had entire phylums of phun. I was the one who [recommended that he be our Science Guest](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/109707.html), issued him the invitation, coordinated his schedule, mailed him a copy of "[Galileo's Children, Tales of Science and Superstition](http://www.amazon.com/Galileos-Children-Tales-Science-Superstition/dp/1591023157)" as a gift, and took care of him and his daughter while they were here. It was as great to spend time with PZ as I knew it would be. If your locality has a science fiction convention or something comparable that has fans of science, I recommend you do the same! I've done a lot of things for conventions, but never GoH Liaison before, and I learned some details about it, but on the whole I think I did a good job. So does PZ. [He](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/join_us_at_the_sf_con_next_wee.php) has [blogged](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/so_i_just_stepped_off_an_airpl.php) about the [convention](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/we_have_a_plan.php) several [times](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/a_busy_day.php), and included [a photo of us](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/confusion_2007.php), taken by Rachel. So he linked to my website repeatedly! I am gratified by what was written about it in his comments section. My latest harvest of thank-you letters was unusually large as a result, and there was no hate-mail in it this time. For those of you reading from Pharyngula, here is a cute bit of controversy about Kent Hovind's prison sentence from the Pensacola Christian College email list. My favorite part, as you'll see, was by Paul Perdue, known as "Mr. X" for having run a secret underground student newspaper for which many students were expelled while I was attending there.

Wow, the link to the news article is informative, but following it into the discussion forum that it spawned is simply amazing. I just hit the point where the old Darwin "death bed confession" urban legend is being invoked, and a general flame war is erupting. Entertaining, in a kinda scary way.

Will this affect the school in anyway? Do you think any of the current students are aware of this?

The current students are quite aware. It won't affect the school, though. Hovind and the PCC administration have been denouncing each other for a decade or two.

Makes sense.

When I was there, Hovind would preach in chapel. But I guess, if he's become a wacky tax protestor, there's no way the school would join up with that.
