I _need_ to understand web server software administration better. I've just been using a handy web interface called "cpanel" with which to manage my web space. It has a bit called Fantastico which will install and uninstall a piece of web server software with the click of a mouse. It's how I installed Drupal, and now the new Wordpress on [my site](http://nemorathwald.com/). But Fantastico only works for web software on its list. Needless to say, anything that I program in Python using the Django web development framework will not be on that list. I'll need to take that code and put it on a web server so that it's a web application. I'm not completely clear on which types of tasks I need to learn. For instance, I assume one uses some kind of command line to do this. And I'd bet good money I should resume reading _UNIX For The Beginning Mage_\*, because it will probably involve understanding directory structure and scripting. \*Oh no! [His site broke!](http://adminspotting.net/) Good thing I downloaded [the free PDF](http://nemorathwald.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/unixforthebeginningmage.pdf).

I've not installed anything like Django on my site, but if memory serves, it runs it's own webserver (much like Mongrel for Ruby). If that's the case, getting it to integrate with an Apache web instance is tricky. On the second point (learning UNIX), I'm presenting at Penguicon (of all places) a "Beginner's Baptism to the UNIX command line", so you'll at least get 50 minutes of introduction. If you need any further help or just someone to look over your virtual shoulder, just shoot me a note (my contact information is at http://decafbad.net).
