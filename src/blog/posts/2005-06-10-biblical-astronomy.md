Did you really think that every modern bible believer accepts the findings of Copernicus? Witness so-called Creation Science in its purest and least hypocritical form. [Geocentricity.com](http://www.geocentricity.com/) is the homepage of the Biblical Astronomy Association. They attempt to prove the existence of "the firmament" using sophistries and fallacious reasoning clothed in scientific language. All that serves as a good education in how to detect their type of pseudoscience through its comparison with other pseudosciences like Creationism, but when you get to their Credo they unclothe their dishonesty in plain sight: _"...All scientific endeavor which does not accept this revelation from on high without any reservations, literary, philosophical or whatever, we reject as already condemned in its unfounded first assumptions. We believe that the creation was completed in six twenty-four hour days and that the world is not older than about six thousand years. We maintain that the Bible teaches us of an earth that neither rotates daily nor revolves yearly about the sun; that it is at rest with respect to the throne of him who called it into existence; and that hence it is absolutely at rest in the universe. ..."_ {blah blah blah salvation} _" Lastly, the reason why we deem a return to a geocentric astronomy a first apologetic necessity is that its rejection at the beginning of our Modern Age constitutes one very important, if not the most important, cause of the historical development of Bible criticism, now resulting in an increasingly anti-Christian world in which atheistic existentialism is preaching a life that is really meaningless."_ So there they blow it by showing their hand and revealing what's really at stake is that they can't mature emotionally and accept the cosmos as it is. As soon as they remove such passages (the same way Creationism was dressed up as Intelligent Design) watch out Kansas school boards. What is really most important about this website is that they acknowledge, and effectively demonstrate with specific passages and arguments about them, that the Christian bible teaches geocentrism and cannot be accepted literally without it. The bible must be taken figuratively.

I'm not convinced that isn't a hoax site. I'm leaning toward real, but...

Ha ha ha. And I suppose all the probes and planetary rovers got to their destinations by magic? Geocentricity has nothing to do with the credibility of creation science or whether God may or may not exist. However these guys are definitely off their rockers. And even though the solar system is heliocentic, the rest of the universe obviously does not revolve around us. We're not even important enough to get to be in the center of the Local Group.

This reminds me of an incident that I had read about somewhere, though the source escapes me. Apparently there was once a debate between "Intelligent Design" advocates and a panel of other folks who happened not to be insane. Perhaps it was a school board meeting, I don't know. The ID people took great pains to try to and legitimize their cause using scientific jargon and the usual logical fallacies. Their opponents were of course batting them down as fast as they could manage. Anyway, at one point the ID advocate mentioned that he thought that flat-earth belief was nonsense, and that nobody in his organization had anything to do with flat-earthism. At that point a member of the audience, who had come there to support the Creationists, stood up and proclaimed indignantly that not only was he a member of the Creationists' organization, but also a senior officer in the Flat Earth Society. This gentleman was greatly offended at the way that the Creationists snubbed what he thought was a perfectly reasonable "theory", and stormed out of the building. I really wish I could remember where I read that.
