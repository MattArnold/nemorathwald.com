[OpenCola](http://www.colawp.com/colas/400/cola467_recipe.html) wouldn't carbonate very much. However, it tasted much, much better than it did when completely flat. Next year we'll do two things to make it a fizzier soft drink: carbonate the water before mixing it with the syrup, and use phosphoric acid instead of citric acid. The citric acid made us radically reduce the orange, lime and lemon oils in the flavor formula to compensate for its taste. We made several improvements to the recipe, so the "Penguicon build" of OpenCola will go on next year's Penguicon website soon. New flavors are also planned. I was pleased when the Chaos Guest did not suck. At ConClave 2004, I approached Bill about a sudden brainstorm. "Bill! We have a tech guest, an author guest, a media guest and a gaming guest. OK: CHAOS GUEST." Bill came up with the idea that this should be a randomly selected attendee. At opening ceremonies I said, "Bill and I went certifiably insane and are going to try something cool and fun and see if it works. This is an experimental convention so we try weird stuff and see whether it sucks, but this could be awesome. Some of you may have noticed on the cover of the program book, in the characature of the Guests of Honor, a shadowy figure labeled SECRET MYSTERY SURPRISE INSIDE. This is because we don't know who it is yet. Neither does this guest. But we will find out... now." Dramatic pause. "Everyone look under your chairs." Then someone behind me (Cory or Nat, I think) started saying "you win a car, and you win a car, and you win a car..." But what was found taped to the bottom of 11 chairs were rainbow-colored ribbons. One was mis-spelled "CHOAS GUEST" (isn't that chaotic?) and the other ten were "CHAOS NIFTY." Our Chaos Guest was Natalie, better known as Gnat. "Bill, tell them what they've won!" I read an invitation letter to her: "Dear occupant," and she accepted. She got a free membership in next year's convention, access to the green room, and could make up two or three panel topics which would be written in to the schedule. The Chaos Nifty guest ribbons were handed out in case she declined.

Don't know what you used as "water" to start with, but your carbonization issues could be due to hard water. You might try getting some RO or deionized next time as that should be easier to carbonate (if I understand water chemistry correctly; maybe it works the other way, and more calcium in your water would ease carbonation? Anyway, consider your water source too.). --Bill

Thanks! What is RO? Can you give us more information or where to look?

RO == Reverse Osmosis. Basically, you push water at a sieve, the lil' water molecules go through, the big organics and such don't. People with reef tanks (aquaria) will typically know what RO is. Chem buildings tend to have taps with RO water which is also tripple-deionized. Water so clean it's insulating, instead of conductive. That's what micro-semens (probably mis-spelt) is a measure of; conductivity. You might ask \[eviljohn\], as I bet he knows how hardness relates to carbonization, as he does the opposite of what you want. He uses co2 to disolve more calcium into his reef tank. --Bill

We use RO in AZ to have drinkable water. Apparently it's good enough to wash dishes with and shower with, but not drinkable unless you run it through RO.

I need Natalie's full name, address & etc. to register her for next year. I don't have any pre-reg forms with a "chaos guest" Thank you!

Done.

Actually, they were all spelled wrong, at least my Nifty one was.

Yay Chaos!

I'd suggest less lavender oil in the Open Cola. Bleeeeechh! (Other than that edge of lavender, it wasn't bad. )

Duly noted. Thanks for the feedback!

I remember when you two came up with the idea. It was like "OMG! This is SO going to work! Whoa... Cool!" I am happy that I got to help by running and dancing around the ballroom and putting the envelopes under random chairs. Little did I know, there was actually a video camera recording my actions, that could be watched from the registration booth! Ooops! At least no one was caring about that particular tv. :)

I liked the OC cola a lot. Thanks for experimenting! Now I'm tempted to make some myself. I agree with all suggestions so far for improving the taste. At the con, somebody read the ingredients list, made a sour face, and made some negative comment about all the oils... I just said, "Well, it's better than reading an ingredients list that sounds like a chemistry experiment!" Hmm.... Evil thought entering mind. Can we do a reasonable taste-alike of Mountain Dew? Can we grind up and dissolve enough Penguin Mints to give it that kick? And lastly (here's the evil part), instead of using food colorings to make it yellow-green, just exactly how "non-toxic" are those calulyme light sticks? :-D It would be awesome to serve "radioactive" dew substitute. Although it might be a bit scary on the way out....

Would you like to be in charge of inventing the recipe for OpenDew? We'll serve it! You must come to a concom meeting and discuss this with us!

Hah! I sense a diabolical plot to get me more involved in the con! You are evil, sir. Pure evil. :-D

I almost forgot. I got so caught up in the cola.... I originally wanted to say what a great idea Chaos GoH was! I hope to see it again next year.
