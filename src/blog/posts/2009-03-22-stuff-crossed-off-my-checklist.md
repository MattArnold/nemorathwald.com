We have replaced Spider Robinson with not one, but two Guests of Honor: author Sarah Hoyt, and past GoH John "maddog" Hall of Linux International. I finally finished the plan I originally had for [the "What Is Penguicon" page](http://penguicon.org/whatisit.php). Thanks to for the solar system graphics. I also finally got [our convention rules](http://penguicon.org/rules.php) up on the website. The additional Chaos Toy components are purchased. My preparations for Opening Ceremonies are now sufficient. I would appreciate any ideas you come up with, for how to make it more than announcements and a series of brief speeches-- but if that's all it is, at least it'll be pretty, shiny and snazzy. We have a t-shirt design, based on the solar system visual theming, which I like. A local artist, Bill Bryant, delivered the sketch you see here, and is almost done with the painting.

She did! Didn't she pass on my feedback? Do you have my email address?

I hadn't heard any feedback yet, no. I'm just trying to work out my schedule, because I now may not be able to make it in time for opening ceremonies. What time are they on Friday? I don't think I have your email, but mine is gozergames at gmail.

I don't know if you realize this Matt, but this t-shirt design is Horrible. I saw you post this a few days ago and I thought maybe I was being a little critical. Then, I came back a few times and kept looking. My opinion hasn't changed unfortunately. What happened to getting a few different artist/designers making a few sketches and the concom voting on the designs that came out? Why is This the shirt to use instead of the Obama parody one? OP made me happy. This doesn't. I realize when you were talking about it that you said the "shape" of Tux would be different. I didn't realize you'd take him from a regular penguin to an Emperor penguin. And what is with the planets? What does that represent about Penguicon? Honestly, I can't imagine Anybody wanting to purchase this and wearing it with pride. Baby Jesus is crying tears of sadness at this. Srsly. Tears. Of. Sadness. I don't want to offend Bill by any means, because it's not that he is a BAD artist. He's just not really getting the feeling of Penguicon with this design.

_"What happened to getting a few different artist/designers making a few sketches and the concom voting on the designs that came out?"_ That was my desire, but the artists failed to deliver candidates. This was the only candidate other than the Obama one. _"Why is This the shirt to use instead of the Obama parody one? OP made me happy. This doesn't."_ A lot of people would not want to label themselves with a political symbol on their shirt. An alien solar system is science fictional. Last year's American politics is not. As conchair, I made a decision not to do that. Especially since I think the full-color painting we have is quite beautiful. _"And what is with the planets? What does that represent about Penguicon?"_ See [What Is Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/whatisit.php) for the answer to that. _"I don't want to offend Bill by any means, because it's not that he is a BAD artist. He's just not really getting the feeling of Penguicon with this design."_ Bill is not responsible for that either. He didn't know much about Penguicon and needed me to give him an idea. The best I could do at the late date was give him the "What Is Penguicon" page. I'm happy with the result. I'm very interested in hearing adjustments that could be made to the shirt. Do you have a suggestion? Unfortunately, rejecting it in favor of something else is not a helpful suggestion, or one that I could consider, because there are no alternative designs, and the t-shirt company's deadline is tomorrow.

While I totally grasp that we didn't have a lot of choices... I am very glad I didn't pre-order a shirt all the same... :(
