I've finished my artwork for the t-shirt for Penguicon 4.0, which is less than a month away. [Looney Labs](http://www.wunderland.com/WhatsOld/2006/WN.03.23.06.html) likes the Mad Lab Rabbit Tux and is displaying it on their site. I've put the complete t-shirt design behind the cut. ![](http://wiki.penguicon.org/penguicon4tshirt) The programming schedule is now up on the web! **[Click here to see it on our staff's online room booking system.](http://peanut.mtu.net/tentative/)**

There's this really cool site on the internet, and the company is sending their main executive in charge of open source software development to be Penguicon's guest of honor. You might have heard of them. [Click here to see their site](http://www.google.com/) and check out how their logo is designed.

Okay, I get that google is coming, and we're trying to show support, but why three ooo's? Why not two?

At the bottom of a search results page, there are usually a lot of "o"s. I wanted to put several more but couldn't fit them. Do you think I should reduce it to two?

Well, for me personally, I associate google with the two OO's, not the ones at the bottom of the search page. Maybe you should make a poll. :D

I would go with two O's too.

\*I\* got the joke, but I'd either use two O's or a WHOLE LOT more.

I got the joke, \*and\* I think three "o"s is a good number (because two would be "proper", and hence too few, but more than three gets a bit hard on the real estate). I also dig the way it makes you pronounce it "Pen-GUI-con" (pen-gooey-con), as one of my friends already insists on pronouncing Penguicon that way.

Never let it be said that I don't listen to the audience. The public has spoken and the art has now been updated.
