I'm making some changes to the schedule database to make it more publishable, but I need some help going into the online site for the schedule and doing some easy stuff that is a lot of busywork. Right now I'm going to get car repairs; then there's Festifools; and on and on. I'm swamped. Anybody want to give me a hand?

Is it something I can do from home?

Yes; it's data entry through a web browser.

Okay. Give me the details. I can spend some time on it today.

I notice it was not started. Did you get my email?

No, I never heard from you. What address did you send it to?

It's a Gmail account, with your first name before a dot and your last name after the dot.

Ah, sorry. I never check that one. I see it now. Update your address book to cmbender@benderhome.net. I'll take a look at it now.

Matt, Do you still need help with this today? I'm home and could lend a hand is so. Tomorrow is filled with stuff for the Stilyagi voting meeting, so I can't do anything then. Wow, there is a lot of schedule there! How much more is left?
