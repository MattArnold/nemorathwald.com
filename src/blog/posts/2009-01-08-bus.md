Today I bought a $10 all-semester student bus pass at Washtenaw Community College and took my first successful trip on The Ride. Granted, it took ten times as long as it had to because I took the long way by mistake, but I got to my destination and back. I like riding the bus. I can just sit there and do flashcards and listen to podcasts or read a book. I find it relaxing.

I don't know if I could relax. I guess I'd be afraid of missing my stop. Still - when I visit D.C. and Philadelphia oh so many years ago - I did enjoy using the Metro and the bus system. It was new and novel to me. What a way to get around!

it's fine as long as they show up on time.
