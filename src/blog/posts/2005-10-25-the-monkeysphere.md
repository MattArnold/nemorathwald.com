One of the more fun examples of brain science on the web is [The Monkeysphere](http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/monkeysphere.html). I would have mentioned it yesterday but it's not a mind hack exactly. It's just knowledge. You may or may not behave differently after you read it. But you'll probably laugh.

yeah. that was a good read. now i need to get back to work instead of ripping off a huge faceless organization where I only know 12 people.

this concept of the monkeysphere helps me not feel guilty because i can't care about the victims of Katrina and all the other recent disasters as much as i feel i should. For all i know, The Gulf Coast doesn't even exist and there's just a huge conspiracy to make me believe it does. Those folks are WAY outside my monkeysphere. excellent read.
