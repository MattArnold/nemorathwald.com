Exercise should be a game. Right now, from a game perspective, the repetitive motions are just like level-grinding. The genius of Dance Dance Revolution is that it takes the boredom out of exercise. To expand on this, a game should use all four limbs and not just jumping around. Something different from a rythm game, though. I'm thinking of a fighting game. A couple of hacked Wiimotes, one in each hand, could be detected in eight positions around a circle. The player stands on a dance pad, to control dodging.

I've read that research is being conducted on what types of Wii-like games could be created that will incorporate the use of a variety of muscles. There is potential this concept would work well for physical rehab. NPR also did a piece on the potential health benefits with older adults. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16890505

I'm pretty sure there's already a Wii boxing game.
