< sarcasm > If you believe a human embryo is a person, and that we are obligated to bring it to term, I suggest you avert your eyes from this scene of murder unless you have a strong stomach. < /sarcasm > I'll bet after it thaws out in that trash bag, that embryo is thinking, "I am relieved! Thank goodness the suspended animation which was keeping me in a Terry-Schiavo-like state of life support is going to collapse now and let nature take its course as God intended. That was a close one-- at least I wasn't experimented on for life-saving research." Oh wait... No. It's _not_ thinking that, because it is a _speck of cells lacking any neurological structure_ for self-awareness. It wouldn't even be able to get past the word "I". _Thanks to [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/08/all_thats_being_discarded_is_a.php) and [DefCon](http://defconblog.org/2006/08/what-happens-to-all-those-unused-embryos/) for the link. ... and now has [picked it up, with nice compliment](http://users.livejournal.com/jer_/98402.html). Thanks, !_

Thank you for that. The idea that science has the means to learn how to grow me a kidney to my exact specifications, and yet there are those in power who would deny me this life-saving option is rather horrifying.

I like the little "choose life" tag. That video has me craving some liquid nitrogen ice cream.

That's a good one. Unfortunately, it makes me want to restart my rant about over-the-counter birth control pills :p
