You guys didn't want to go with me to "[The Gallery Project](http://www.thegalleryproject.com/)", so you missed out! It's still running until 4PM Sunday afternoon, so you still have a chance.

I wonder if we should send the gallery some of your pictures... I noticed that they were putting up some of the other ones that were taken. :)
