[Councilroom.com](http://councilroom.com/) is a fan site for the card game [Dominion](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) that analyzes statistics from logs of all games played online at [dominion.isotropic.org](http://dominion.isotropic.org/). They put out the call for some graphics, and I have begun to submit some! For instance, I made the favicon which you can see in the title bar, depending on which browser you use. I am sending them a lot of unlockable achievement badges, which they are gradually programming into the system. For instance, if you look at [the player page about "theory"](http://www.councilroom.com/player?player=theory) (who is one of the best players), you will see which awards he has so far under the "Goals" section. And here is [my player page](http://www.councilroom.com/player?player=NemoRathwald). Hover the mouse over a badge to see what it is for. Have fun playing around with the [interactive graphs](http://councilroom.com/win_rate_diff_accum.html?cards=Cost%3D%3D5%26%26Actions%3D%3D1). In other news, Dominion itself is unlocking some achievements, so to speak! It has sold more than a million copies. Congratulations to DXV! (That's Donald X Vaccarino.) A half-size expansion titled "Dominion: Cornucopia" is soon to be released, as well as a large expansion late in 2011, and another promo card to be distributed at game cons. From the promotional text to "Cornucopia":

> It adds 13 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus 5 unique cards. The central theme is variety; there are cards that reward you for having a variety of cards in your deck, in your hand, and in play, as well cards that help you get that variety.

I guess that prevents me from releasing my Trevor Jagoda Penguicon card, as a Victory card worth 1 VP for every two differently-named cards in your deck at the end of the game. Something like that is bound to be in Cornucopia. Speculation is rife as to what DXV means by "unique card". He is secretive as usual. Perhaps each game you play with Cornucopia will include only one copy of each Unique! Or, perhaps it introduces variable player powers because each type of Unique would only be purchasable by one player per game. As usual, we'll keep arguing about it until the rulebook is finally released.
