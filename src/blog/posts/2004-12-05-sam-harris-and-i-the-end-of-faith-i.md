It's heartening to encounter a kindred spirit. If I collected my essays and published them as a book, it would take the same essential positions as this bestselling book that Sam Harris has now published, titled [The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/542154/104-7283789-4098341) [You need to read this interview.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/542154/104-7283789-4098341) I'm far from the only person who has come to these realizations, and it's clearly spreading.
