Those of you who have visited my home might recognize [these images of O'Neill space colonies,](http://www.l5news.org/oneillcylinder.htm) because I downloaded a few of them, printed each one on several sheets, cut and taped them together, and framed them. Last week, Karl Schroeder posted the cover of his new book _Lady of Mazes_ to [his literature blog.](http://www.kschroeder.com/) I commented: "Wow... I want to hang it on my wall. I've often wondered, is it possible to obtain poster prints of SF covers instead of paying for the original painting at an SF convention art show? Probably I'll just have to settle for scanning the book cover at hi-res and printing out a copy on several sheets of paper... my usual method." Yesterday Karl sent me [a link to the website of the artist, Stephan Martiniere.](http://www.martiniere.com/) I recognized many of the paintings, such as [Newton's Wake](http://www.martiniere.com/newtonswake.htm) and [Polyhedron.](http://www.martiniere.com/polyhedron.html) I've seen them individually and admired them-- even pointed out to people how nice they were-- but now that I see they are all by the same artist, I have become a fan. Today I received an e-mail from Stephan saying Karl wrote him about my plight, and that _Lady of Mazes_ is available as a print. "No need to pay for an original," he wrote, "the painting is digital anyway." His site takes Paypal! Joy!
