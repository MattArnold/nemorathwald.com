![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000btbk0) Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to replacing my graphics tablet! The question is not whether or not it succeeded, but which tablet to choose! As you can see from the notes, I now need to choose between the trusted expensive stingy-size brand or the untrusted brand that's plenty large enough and priced for humans. I would like to find out why graphics tablets command higher-than-retail value on eBay. Amazon.com has good prices. I won't wait around for a rare deal to arrive, because your sketches await! Thanks again!
