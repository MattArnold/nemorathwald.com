According to [Evolution As A Team Sport](http://www.rushkoff.com/2005/03/evolution-as-team-sport.php) by Douglas Rushkoff, the Renaissance had many ways in which that which had been 2 dimensional became 3 dimensional. (Such as perspective painting, circumnavigating the globe, and calculus.) In the current web-enabled Renaissance, such trends continue. Read the article. "Originally, the collective was the clan or the tribe - an entity defined no more by what members had in common with each other than what they had in opposition to the clan or tribe over the hill. Networks give us a new understanding of our potential relationships to one another. Membership in one group does not preclude membership in a myriad of others. We are all parts of a multitude of overlapping groups with often paradoxically contradictory priorities. Because we can contend with having more than one perspective at a time, we needn't force them to compete for authority in our hearts and minds - we can hold them all, provisionally. That's the beauty of renaissance: our capacity to contend with multiple dimensions is increased. Things don't have to be just one way or directed by some central authority, alive, dead or channeled. We have the capacity to contend with spontaneous, emergent reality."
