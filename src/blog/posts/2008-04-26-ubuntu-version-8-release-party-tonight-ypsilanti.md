7 PM until late at the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti (720 Norris St), there's a release party for version 8 (codename "Hardy Heron") of Ubuntu Linux! For those who email me to say they don't have the context to know what I'm talking about on this LJ half the time: Ubuntu Linux is basically a free alternative to Microsoft's Windows, Explorer, and Office. It works great and it's really easy. You should try it. With any luck they'll be handing it out on CD for free tonight so you can beat the current swamped rush of downloaders. I'll be at the party. Join in!
