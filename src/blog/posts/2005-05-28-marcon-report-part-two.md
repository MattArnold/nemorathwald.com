I'm already two-thirds through my 12 volunteering hours to be comped. I might go ahead and go 18 hours to get a free Marcon T-shirt. I like this internet cafe. It's 8 AM and I'm getting my caffiene fix while waiting for the volunteer table to open. I used this cyber espresso bar when I was here for Origins a couple of years ago. But Aaron and I had to make coffee in the room this morning. Can you believe they close Consuite from 3 to 9 AM at this convention? We've been touting the fact that Penguicon's Consuite never closes. Already we've gotten several people interested in attending. The hotel staff is very nice. They made a mistake in booking the room for tonight's CafePenguicon party, so they are giving us a whole party suite for the price of the King room that we had asked for!

hmm.. so I guess if you're at marcon you're not doing any further revisions of our flyer... (did you take any ConFusion flyers to Marcon?)

I really wanted to. I got no feedback on my last revision,and at the rate that Krysta was making changes she probably wouldn't be satisfied without two or three more rounds of revisions anyway. Plus my printer isn't working.

There are benefits to having the hotel screw up... sometimes. :)
