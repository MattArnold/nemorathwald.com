Last night I went to Java Hutt with a [childfree](http://www.geocities.com/nokiddingdetroit/) who I met on the internet. It was a fascinating and animated conversation about the Universe, the unlikelihood of reincarnation, and the meaning of life, among other topics such as cable TV. There were fruit-flavored syrups on the list at the coffee shop. This surprised me so I decided to try Grape syrup in my coffee because I love novelty for its own sake. In retrospect it was clearly intended for Italian ice sodas. I went next door to Library Bookstore and bought [_Supermen, Tales of the Posthuman Future,_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312275692/104-2828499-9774316?v=glance) by Gardner Dozois because it contains _Border Guards_ by my favorite author, Greg Egan, which I somehow haven't read, and _Fossil Games_, by Tom Purdom, which is one of my favorite stories. I pinned up [Penguicon](http:www.penguicon.org) flyers on all the bulletin boards in downtown Ferndale. I'm hosting [SEMI-Abstract Gamers](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/semi-abstract-gamers/) at my house tonight at 7 to playtest and judge the [Piecepack](http://www.piecepack.org/) competition. Any games-playing friends are welcome!
