I became heavily involved in several things this year, including running conventions, administrating web communities for secular alternatives to church, and learning Lojban. I got reliable employment and a stable residence arrangement. My ex-wife changed beyond recognition and I got much more involved with her than I expected to. In the upcoming year, I'd like to ... A. ... finish becoming a hacker according to the four steps of [How To Become A Hacker by Eric S. Raymond:](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) --1. ... start learning a programming language, Python. The last time I programmed was in Basic on the Commodore 64, almost 20 years ago in my pre-teens. --2. ... dedicate more worthwhile hardware to open-source, and install a build of Linux on it which I can actually get software for. --3. ... write HTML: already done. But I must figure out how to actually put it onto the web without Geocities. I'll learn whatever it is people do to not need other people to put stuff on the web. --4. ... write good English: already done. B. ... reduce my involvement in running conventions to a responsible and realistic level that will not make me dislike what I love most. C. ... learn the next 1,500 words in Lojban and move consistently to at least the sixth stage of expertise [as defined here.](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=vocabulary+expertise+stages) D. ... explore using open-source desktop publishing software. E. ... somehow afford a cellular phone. F. ... get more alone time. This involves moving out R from the woman she currently lives with, so that R will not just use her own place as an expensive storage locker. R's new room share must improve on the current arrangement in several ways. --1. free of mold and other allergens. --2. a roommate who is not ultra-needy, so that R doesn't feel parental and guilty like she does with the current one. --3. internet access, since I've got R hooked on the web and her only access is work and my place. --4. costing about $300+/- a month. My inner goals are less easily measurable. Four stars: Satisfactory. Three stars: Showing improvement. Two stars: Needs work. 1. Boundaries. \*\*\*\* No change in 2004. 2. Self-direction. Last year: \*\*\* This year: \*\* 3. Tolerance. Last year: \*\* This year: \*\* 4. Acceptance of uncertainty. \*\*\*\* No change in 2004. 5. Flexibility. Last year: \*\* This year: \*\*\* 6. Scientific thinking. \*\*\*\* No change in 2004. 7. Commitment. Last year: \*\*\* This year: \*\*\*\* 8. Risk-taking. \*\*\* No change in 2004. 9. Self-acceptance. \*\*\*\* No change in 2004.

I am befuzzled by your inner goals. I don't know if I know how to properly state this into a question either. Your boundaries are set at 4. And there was no change in 2004. Is this a good thing? Does that mean it stayed the same from last year and you hope it stays the same this year? \*quizzically confused\*

My scale only measures whether or not the subject is experiencing a problem. It's always possible to get better and better, even after reaching a satisfactory level. The list is about mental health in general, not any problem I've had in specific. Most items on the list that are just de-programming myself from religious teachings rather than experiencing a problem with the item in question during my history. So as a result, there are things on here that I don't think I've ever had an innate problem with. No matter how much I might improve in those areas, I'm mostly just keeping a lookout for getting worse.
