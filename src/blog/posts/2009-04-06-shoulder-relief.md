I have found shoulder relief in ibuprofen, steaming baths\*, and the liberal application of Icy Hot. However, I take note that my shoulders did not hurt during the most physically active time of the weekend, as I reported in the last post. Each time I lower my head to clear the roof of the car while entering or exiting, I clench the diaphragm of the lungs, _bracing_ for a potential spike of agony. This habit no doubt exacerbates the problem. I think the acid reflux and muscle pain are probably symptoms of stress. This is good news! It suggests these might be conditional, and therefore temporary! Soon I will no longer get up as early as 5 AM to make a three hour round trip every day, no longer carry my entire laptop and tablet system in order to be able to perform paying work, no longer struggle to catch up with my class when I drag myself in late. And so forth. Does Penguicon have something to do with it? Well, of course, that comes and goes with each crisis to be fixed, but I doubt it is as severe a factor as the job.

\* "Baths" is typically pronounced with a wispy and insubstantial unvoiced "th". I say thee, _nay_. This instance is to be pronounced with an emphasis on a prolonged voiced "th" as in the start of "there". And also a British "ah". Bahttttttttthz.

I agree completely with your analysis :-) And I, too, enjoy indulging in bahttttthz from time to time for the relief of occasional neck and shoulder pain due to stress. ;-) So nice, aren't they? Anyway, glad to know you're aware of it, and also glad to hear it will be temporary. I do hope you find some work that isn't so stressful for you.

I want to also remind you that we know some trained professional massage therapists. I think that if you asked them nicely, that you might find some relief. I was in huge pain Christmas before last and it went away completely when I got a bit of rubbing. Good luck.

Like sheryl said see a massage therapist, hint hint my wife is one and if you can not see one before con she will have both her chair and table with her. also I am sure she would be more than happy to massage on you at the next meeting in less than two weeks if you ask. All of this is under the assumption that you don't get one before then and/or you are still in pain.
