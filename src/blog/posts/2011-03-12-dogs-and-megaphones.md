Delightful. When the dogs start a paroxysm of barking, I can tell them to stop via my new megaphone, and they will obey. If it's unholy-o-clock in the morning, I don't even have to get out of bed. There is no potential for disturbance, because they only bark if my roommate is not home.

Just give me enough warning so that I can cover my ears!

I wonder how they will respond to the godzilla roar?
