I know I'm on to something when I think "what should I do next with my day?" and my first thought is "open 3D software and work on modeling and rigging my character." When I wonder about whether I will be outcompeted in the animation industry, I just think of all the people who dropped out of the program, or thought of joining it but didn't, because they say it's too monotonous or they lack the patience. Well. I do not lack it. For me, catching a tiny flicker in one marker out of 52, and zapping it, lavishes me with the addictive satisfaction of playing Bejeweled. I named every nut and bolt on my robot, every hinge and axle, tension and compression member, screw drive and planetary gear, valve and pipe, knob and cowling, so I can can find them. Every _rivet_. "Hello, chassisFrontSecondRivet. How are you this fine evening? Why you're right, leftTopEscapement. It is morning. I stand corrected. I must have lost track of time." That having been said, I recognize the value of lazy efficiency to be more productive. If only Maya's boolean union were not so famously broken, I could just merge the rivets and the chassis into one surface and call the whole thing "chassis". Alas.
