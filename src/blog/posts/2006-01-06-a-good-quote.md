Paul Z Myers has an entry on his [Pharyngula blog](http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/memes_gone_bad/) concerning some of the world's worst memes. In response to the meme "Abortion stills a beating heart," PZ retorts: "Yeah, and my humanity is embedded entirely in Hodgkin and Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction, and my mind is just a rhythmic pacemaker potential." His comments to the other memes are similarly wonderful, but this one is my favorite.

Mousetraps still a beating heart too; should we outlaw mousetraps?
