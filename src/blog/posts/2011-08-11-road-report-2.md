We made it to Richmond just after midnight. It didn't take long for me to find the local hackerspace, [Hack.RVA](http://hackrva.org/). I plan to go to their open work night tonight. My friend's plans are in flux because his various interviews are rescheduling and he's getting new ones in new places. Massachusetts, which was supposed to be today, is postponed to Monday. If his trip extends too much, it might turn out to be necessary for him to send me back via Greyhound next week so I can meet my moving-out deadline of Saturday August 20. We'll see. Now we have a conference call with the software company I previously mentioned that we are contracting for.
