Is patronage the new viable business model artists will have to move to in the digital future? Maybe if they can't get paid for copies of their recordings, we could pay them to write the songs in the first place. [Songs To Wear Pants To](http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/index.php) is a guy who writes and records a free one-minute song when someone sends in a request, or he'll write and record a longer song with any description as long as you pay him to do so. Instead of being patronized by the Medici dynasty, artists in the future could get coins tossed in their hat by Ed Gruberman of Milwaukee. The result is like an episode of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" The lyrics to song #0257, "This Girl", are particularly funny if you read the request before you listen. I intend to get a paid piece of music for a Flash animation I'm planning.
