I'm writing this into my pen computer on Saturday in front of the [Maryland Science Center](http://www.mdsci.org/) while waiting for a free concert of [They Might Be Giants](http://www.tmbg.com/)! This is because Friday I ran into Molly, a relative of Rob Landley who I met at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/). She lives in this area. She invited me to go with her friends to this show. I listen to TMBG all the time. What an opportunity! It will be my first rock concert. The weather's beautiful. There's a huge metal [tensegrity](http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/straw-tensegrity.html) sculpture overhead. Saturday I wore my t-shirt that reads "The Society for the Conservation of Angular Momentum, 'Preserving a Rational Universe for Our Children.'" A guy approached me in the convention's consuite to tell me that angular momentum can't ever be depleted. "It's an infinitely renewable resource," he explained. "I take it you're not part of SCAM?" "No way, I'm not a tree-hugging environmentalist freak. You guys are just scare-mongering with politically-motivated science in order to destroy consumerism. I'm an American! Responsible adults should be allowed to exert as much or as little momentum as we desire in any and all angles we see fit." We laughed. "Now I know I can really tell I'm in the Beltway," I responded. "Does SCAM plan to protest the [Dean drive](http://www.jerrypournelle.com/sciences/dean.html)?" asked a woman. "Of course we will," I said, "although it's hardly any worse transgressive, syncretic cyberbabble than any other faster-than-light travel." Overhearing our conversation, another guy approached. "Excuse me, are you [LARPing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game)?" he said hesitantly. "Where do I sign up?"
