Did you know there is an LJ community for [Bi Poly Kinky Pagan Gamer Geeks](http://community.livejournal.com/bipolypagangeek/profile)? Obviously it's full of cool people. The intro asks that prospective members have at least five out of the six traits. There can be no question I'm a poly, a gamer, and a geek. On the other hand, while I'm friendly and reasonably well-informed when it comes to bi, kinky, and pagan, the best I can do is to be GGG (Good, Giving and Game). So, the "Watch" option is the one intended for me, rather than the "Join" option.

Thank you, Matt; I likely wouldn't have stumbled across this on my own. (:
