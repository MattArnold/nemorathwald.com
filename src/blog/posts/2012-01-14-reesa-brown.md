It was pointed out to me that Kit's memorial entry is friend-locked. I've stopped reading me and Reesa's old IM logs and leaking from the eyes long enough that I have some of my own things to say. Reesa was fascinating; and she was interested in interesting things. I don't talk much about past or present partners; but anyone with whom I have privately discussed Reesa knows that I pretty much glow about her, and that I'm not just praising her now because of the circumstances. She gave of herself with an generosity, courage, and forthrightness that served as a positive role model for me when I needed one. I'm not saying she was perfect. But her flaws never really did much to me. My trajectory through her life was caught in the spotlight beam of brilliance. She just didn't seem to settle for anything, even if everybody in the world thought you would obviously fail. She was an example of how the whole world could be wrong about that. The whole world was wrong about a lot of things. Whether it be in her entrepreneurship, her relationship style, her resourcefulness, her innovative ideas, and her courage in all areas of life; I admired that, and admiration has always been an aphrodisiac to me. I never imagined a world without Reesa in it. I really thought she had it licked for the last time, and was out of the woods. I'm proud to have introduced her to her husband Nathan Elliott, and my thoughts go out to him at this time.

Thanks for posting about it. Brian saw your post and mentioned it to me when I got back from the Albuquerque science fiction society meeting a while ago. We had some amazing times, eh? I'm sorry I soured it, but I treasure most of the memories.

If you backtrack to todfox's main LJ page, he has a link to his unlocked blog, which it appears he considers his "real" page and LJ is cross-posted from. She seems like a lovely lady; my condolences and sympathies.

I didn't know you introduced her to Nathan. What a weird small world it is. It was that same bright, brilliant light which attracted me to her in the first place, and wherever we ended up at the end it still touched me -- I know the world is a weaker place without that light in it. I too thought she'd beaten the cancer -- through that amazing force of will she could exert. I've been told she went gracefully, with her family around her, about a month after declaring to some of her family & closest support network that she believed she would be dying. So it sounds like she went in a very 'Reesa' fashion, for whatever comfort that can give. Thank you for sharing this, it's helping me to read others' thoughts.
