I'm being careful how I dress today for promoting Penguicon at MPCon. It's the wrong crowd for the metrosexual look. It is time for the t-shirt reading "one by one, the Penguins steal my sanity" in a distressed font.

Your good man with the work you are putting into Penguicon.

you consider yourself a metrosexual?

I've been told that some days I have tendencies in that direction.

Woah now, that's moving a little bit fast, don't you think? I'm sure there's some equivalent to the Kinsey Scale for this.

hmmm...the metrosexual Kinsey Scale... 0-flannel 1-scruffy look but regularly wears deoderant 2-doesn't know his brands but enjoys hairgel and trimmed facial hair 3-reads GQ and Sports Illustrated 4-Barney ala How I met your Mother 5-never leaves the house without cologne layers but owns a baseball cap 6-manly yet artful cosmetics What do you think?

Very helpful! I'm a 2. The clear conclusion is this. When guys whose wardrobe consists entirely of t-shirts and shorts suggest that I'm metrosexual for my tendency to wear buttoned clothing when I don't have to, it says more about them than about me!

P.S. Before you ask... "facial hair trimmed off _completely_" is another form of "trimmed facial hair". :)

lol, most definitely! I would place you as a 2 as well, a good place to be:)
