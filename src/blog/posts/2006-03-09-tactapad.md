I've dreamed of an input device like [the TactaPad](http://www.tactiva.com/) for years. It resembles a little overhead projector. The camera on the stem is watching your hands and portraying a grey transparent sillhouette of them on the screen so that you don't have to look at your hands. It's a touch-sensitive tablet that can detect the touch of all of your fingers simultaneously, not just one point, and can detect differences in pressure and velocity. The surface gives you force feedback sensations. Watching [the demo movie of TactaDraw](http://www.tactiva.com/demo.html) makes it clear why someone like me who has used art software for years would drool over this. I also would love to play a real time strategy game with this input method. Of course, just as with its countless wonderful predecessors in the field of alternative input devices, there is no reason to expect this to be developed into a product that makes it to market, much less a product that succeeds in the market. Each application would have to be rewritten to accept the unique aspects of its input, and that doesn't tend to happen.
