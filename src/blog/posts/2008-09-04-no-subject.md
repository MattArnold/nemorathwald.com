I love naming things. If you ever find yourself saying, "but what are we going to call it?" please let me name it.

Heh. You'll have to beat my son K to it. He names the squirrels that come to the birdfeeder. He has been known to name flowers in the garden. I suspect he would name the furniture if we suggested it to him. The blue spruce tree is "Bruce".

I think you should help me name my Etsy store. Any ideas?

Last time I said this phrase, a restraining order was issued barring me from many of the local middle schools.

Well, I haven't opened it yet. But will be making things to sell very soon. So I can't so it to you, unless it was something else you wanted to see. :wink:

I just need to know what you're going to sell, and if you have some kind of theme in mind already.
