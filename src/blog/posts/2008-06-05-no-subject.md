Does anybody have a hard drive for a Toshiba Satellite M45 laptop you'd part with for cheap? It came with a Hitachi Travelstar hard drive.

I have a couple of "spare" laptop drives around my house somewhere that should be in good working condition. Bring the laptop, the old drive, and anything else that you think might be needed to the Meeting on Sunday and I will hook you up. The reason I want you to bring the old drive is that sometimes the drives have special harnesses on them so they fit in the laptop and if there is one it will need to be moved to the "new" drive so it will fit.

Also do you have the whole model number it should be M45-Sxxxx and it might be located on the bottom. I would like to look up some of the info on it before I put the drive in.
