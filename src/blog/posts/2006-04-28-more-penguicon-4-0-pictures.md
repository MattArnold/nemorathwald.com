Charles Ulrich has posted more Penguicon 4.0 photos to flickr. [![](http://static.flickr.com/56/135683289_e26b385c45.jpg?v=0)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/11599261@N00/135683289/) To me, the interesting thing about this photo is that Charles Ulrich captioned it with "Matt Arnold doing something in the lounge. I've never seen a man wear so many different shirts in a 48-hour period." [![](http://static.flickr.com/50/135722376_698e725e0f.jpg?v=0)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/11599261@N00/135722376/) I had the idea to make an effigy of Wayport, the evil internet service provider with a contractual chokehold on of most of the convention hotels in Michigan. I'm glad they don't contractually own the drinking fountains or toilets or there would have been vending slots to insert dollars for each use. Of course, we couldn't burn Wayport in effigy because that would certainly violate fire codes. Thank-you to for making this great-looking Wayport pinata on such short notice. Here you see our chief of Operations, Gerald Gentry, holding it while strikes the first blow at the beginning of the Gripe Session. Several people then destroyed it with sticks and tossed handfuls of candy into the crowd.

1\. Eh? What's that about? 2. Yes he did use the wrong ID. 3. Yes, a very nice effort set forth by UHACC. Speaking of UHACC they've posted their P4 pictures here [UHACC Penguicon 4 Pictures](http://uhacc.org/events/penguicon/penguicon4.php)

1\. It's one of those inside things. Although I don't know that will get it anyway, so it's probably just for me. :) 3. Thanky for the clickie!

I don't know what's so interesting about it... You \*do\* wear a lot of shirts! I mean, a lot of people at Penguicon go the whole weekend in (near as I can tell) the same set of clothes. I guess \*any\* change in attire would make one stand out a bit and I'm nearly certain there were at least 4 shirt changes. Is this an accurate estimation of your shirt usage?

I brought six shirts to Penguicon, and wore between three and four shirts per day. Usually I was wearing more than one at a time.

Three to four shirts per day, dang, it wasn't just me! At Penguicon 2 or 3, you had me doubting my own sanity: "Hey there goes Matt Arnold. But wait... isn't he weaing a different shirt than before? Hmm. Maybe he's got a twin? But then they wouldn't both be called Matt now would they?" And than later: "There's Matt again... in yet another shirt? Nah. I just need more Dragonmead."

Aw, shucks, Matt. You shouldn't have given away your secret. I kind of liked the idea that you had an evil twin, walking around. (Frankly, I was too busy at Penguicon to notice that you were changing your shirt that often....)
