Yes, and I was so overwhelmed with the idea that I kept putting off blogging about it for fear of not doing it justice! Yesterday the temp who I'm replacing at this new job told me that, while I was telling her over lunch that I like to think of myself as a bridge between engineers and end-users, it reminded her of the father of a friend of hers. He runs Menlo Innovations. She applied to be a High-Tech Anthropologist despite the fact that she is less technical than me, which suggests that they may not have as strict a requirement as I would demand if I were them. The only reason she didn't take that job was that it consists of three or six month contract work without benefits. Personally I wouldn't mind that. What matters to me, after the intangible compensations, is take-home pay. After she described her experiences in their orientation process, I told her the very idea was like the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

I'm glad you like the idea! I hope you can make it a reality, and it turns out as good or better than the rock candy mountain. \*smile\*
