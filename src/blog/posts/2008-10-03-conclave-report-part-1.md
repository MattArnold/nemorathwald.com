The panel on blogging went well. When I gave a [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/) business card to Michelle Sagara, ConClave's author guest of honor, she said everyone has been telling her to go to it. My presentation on podcasting will start at eight. My laptop broke recently, and loaned me hers. There may or may not be a projector. I'm talking to Gerald now about restaurants for our Thursday night dinner, and discussing how Penguicon's current concom is amazingly non-picky about restaurants this year. Hardly any allergies. We could only think of Lady Sarah's food allergies. While I was at the Lebanese place getting a carryout sandwich, they asked what my badge was about and how many attend ConClave. As a result I may have sold them an ad in the Penguicon program book. I put [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org/) bookmarks on the freebies table and some are already taken.
