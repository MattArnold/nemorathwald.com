Klingon! "Today is a good day to make build!" "You have not updated your ports! You have no honor!" Sorry. BSD Geek jokes, but I find this poll amusing.

Obviously, it should be a B5 uniform. Smarter, better continuity, and a UI that challenges with both "who are you?" \*and\* "what do you want?"

It was not long ago that I was still sufficiently unfamiliar with technology to mistake BSD for "bondage, submission and domination." That's another costume I've seen at con. But I guess I don't want to reinforce that misunderstanding!
