I have a temp job starting tomorrow (Friday) and going through Thursday. The pay rate is wonderfully satisfactory. It's a Production Artist position. Whereas Graphic Design focuses on creativity and taste, Production Art focuses instead on software technical proficiency and special understanding of the final print manufacturing requirements. Right now, Production Art is closer to how I want to use my existing experience and training for my professional life. So this is good news.

Good! I'm always on the lookout for job-related things for my friends, too, you know. Even though, or perhaps especially because, the job market is sucky, I'm still looking around while I'm in and around the workplace.

Congrats Matt. Is there a chance that it could go on longer? And sorry to hijack your post, but did you get your car back?

There is a chance that it could either go on longer, or they will have more work before long that needs someone. I did get it back! Jen came out and picked me up to help with "moving day", and on the way back and forth we stopped at my car and the tire store. There wasn't time to get both tires replaced, but I can use the spare until Saturday. In the meantime, to avoid stressing the spare tire, I'll have to abstain from attending Allison's Fish Fly Festival in New Baltimore tonight.
