Can a Smelter produce more than a Forge? Is a Mill better than a Press? What's more heavy-duty, Welding or Riveting? \[[Poll #1594123](http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=1594123)\]

Smelters get you the metal from the ore, and the forge is where you shape the metal. Mills are where you process the raw material (as in a steel mill), and you use a press to shape the raw material. I'm not quite as sure of a good explanation for riveter/welder, but IMHO rivets are easy to do compared to welding, which takes a lot more skill to make look good, and welding also makes a stronger join I \*think\* (when dealing with a lap joint, which is the same kind of joint you have to make with rivets).

I guess I had a different definition of "mill" in my head. Being that my dad was a tool and die maker, I was thinking of this sort of mill: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling\_machine We had one in our basement. My dad could make almost anything on that thing. So I guess that debate depends on which kind of mill we're discussing.

Excellent point! And that milling machine looks freaking awesome.
