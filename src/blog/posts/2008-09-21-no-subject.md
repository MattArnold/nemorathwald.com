 sent me this image: ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000ckd5q) So I wanted to know who probably created it. [TinEye.com](http://tineye.com/) returned [Mark Humphrys](http://markhumphrys.com/) as a likely candidate.

Glad you liked it. I'm sure you've got plenty of stories that will trump mine. I get the pleasure of dealing with zealots daily and have some real zingers.

Mark Humphrys' site acknowledges http://pics.livejournal.com/matt\_arnold/pic/000ckd5q as source, and a quick look at who posted it there makes it pretty clear it's not primary at that site either. But you might be able to trace it back from there.
