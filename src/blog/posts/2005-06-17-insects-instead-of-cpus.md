[![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0005ygrc)This robot](http://www.conceptlab.com/control/) is controlled by a trackball mounted to it. More to the point, it's controlled by a giant hissing cockroach on the trackball which shies away from lights that are shined in its face when the robot approaches an obstacle. Cool!

best quote: "The cockroach eats almost anything, although it is fed organic lettuce and canned Pedigree "Traditional Ground Dinner With Chopped Beef (Improved Recipe)" dog food. A couple of cockroaches have died after being fed Carl's Jr. - although this may have been a coincidence. "
