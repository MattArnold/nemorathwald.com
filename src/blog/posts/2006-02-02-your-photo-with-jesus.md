What fun. Check out [this business selling photos of Jesus.](http://www.heavenlyimages.com/start.htm) I am almost reminded of the [Underpants Gnomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpants_Gnomes) from South Park. Step 1: "[Trust the Lord to guide me](http://www.heavenlyimages.com/newbrochure/New_Folder/index.htm)" (Direct quote.) Step 2: ??? Step 3: Profit! I wonder if [this story about the Catholic Church copyrighting the Pope's words](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2005615,00.html) indicates that they might start trademarking Jesus some day and put this couple out of business. Besides, if copyright is now 70 years plus the life of the author, and Jesus rose from the dead, doesn't Jesus have a showbiz agent yet to negotiate pay-for-play rights to his appearances?

Yes, I liked that too. :) For a moment it almost convinced me that the whole site was a parody.

The federal government is constitutionally forbidden from recognizing the dogma of Jesus' resurrection. Jesus' and all his works passed into the public domain 1900 years ago. I have mixed feelings about the Catholic Church trying to secure present and future papal writings with copyrights. On the one hand anything that restricts the nonsense that comes out of the Vatican is okay by me. But on the other hand, it's not a bad idea. That makes the church into a business and businesses are taxed. Let's see now, the Catholic Church real holdings and corporate income in the United states taxed at business rates...

The Church of Scientology. All of L. Ron Hubbard's works (fiction and non-fiction) is owned and controlled by Bridge Publications and the Religious Technology Center. I learned this during my few years in that religious philosophy, right during and after divorce #1. It gets to the point that if I were to begin my own auditing course (their name for religious counselling), and not stay in line with what the CoS exactly states as their guidelines from Hubbard's works, I will be accused of "Squirrelling", which is punishable by excommunication. I have also heard "Urban legends" of the CoS, with the help of the U.S. marshalls, kicking in your door and confiscating all of your LRH tech (all of your Dianetics/Scientology stuff). The CoS has learned to get to the letter of the law quite precisely. Needless to say, I stopped my association with them, years ago, taking only what I thought made sense with me.
