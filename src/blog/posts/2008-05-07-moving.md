Unless something unexpected happens, I think this plan is firm enough to announce. Last night I visited Mike, Karen, and Bahb Son Of Bob (). It looks like I can move in to their town-house-like thing in Novi. This will take place some time after Mike ships out to the Middle East this weekend. There is broadband there, so my remote work will be un-interrupted save only for the time it takes to pack and unpack. They have a machine that washes your dishes for you. This apartment complex also has not one, but two types of laundry machines! One washes, the other dries! Living with [the comic genius](http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.mattarn/Penguicon2008/photo#5192580158635965266) Bahb, the possibilities stagger the imagination. Consider in isolation, if you will, merely the opportunities for gaming. To say nothing of collaboration on webcomics and podcasts! I'll live a lot nearer to Blasted Bill () and finally get to see more of him again. Today he came over and fixed my car so that it will start, confirmed that I have two dead motherboards, and helped me retrieve data off my Windows computer. He loaned me a device that fits a hard drive and adapts it to USB. We got a good start on patching together working components from the eight computers in my house into one Frankenputer. In the meantime I have been using a Mac Mini courtesy of my employer. But I am now rapidly regaining full computational capacity around here.

Moving to Novi? Excellent! (Did you never get the Ubuntu desktop up and running?)

I did actually! It worked immediately. But you're standing right next to me at this party, so I'll tell you in person!

Glad you found someplace. In the pictures you linked to: is the Pope outfit the same one that Bill Albin wore for Halloween a few years back?

amanda, yes. we have been using for many things the last several years including pope of conversation(which bahb is) and for matt's coffee ritual services.

Awesome, I'm glad it turned into something more than a one-shot item. :-)

That's kind of nifty! I'm glad they found someone to move in (nicely sized place, after all)! Incidentally this means that there will probably be more gaming and Open Cola dev sessions for all involved.

Yes, Open Soda and Gaming! Bahb's house is now the core!

Yay! Where are you working currently? Or are you not still? :/

My day job is in Southfield. The temp assignment will last a few more weeks.
