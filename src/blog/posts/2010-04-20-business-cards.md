I am being asked for a business card more and more often. But I don't know what to put on it. I considered just putting my name and contact info. says I shouldn't do that, because when they're looking through their business cards later, they won't remember who I am. She says the card should remind them of the context of the conversation. That is unrealistic, because I have too many different conversations. I'm considering three cards: 1. Illustration, Graphic Design, Web Design. This promotes my existing skills, but also transitions into the web development that I'm learning. 2. www.nemorathwald.com. This is my personal site, and would be handed out to new friends. 3. Motion Capture Technician. The odds of handing out this one are low, but I need to be ready if it happens. The good news is that I have discovered clean-edge printable business cards, so I can print off a few of each, and print new ones for any context in which I might find myself.

the type of business card design the cool kids are using nowadays seems to be like a tiny flier. kind of an eye catching illustration motif to them. this could be especially applicable to the graphic design card, and maybe also useful to all of them.

Moo Cards might be of use to you. I think you can get a small sample free even. But they allow different images on the back. So you could do three different images with the same contact info. http://us.moo.com/en/

No, silly, I said that you might want to use different cards depending on whether you want them to remember you in a social context or a business context. :P I can't tell you how many times I've gotten home from networking/convention events and I can't remember whose boring card matches up with which interesting person I talked to. However, I think the one you posted with the barcode is unique enough to not have them scratching their heads. :)
