Remember the remix of Green Day with Dr. Who which [I recently blogged about](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/102757.html)? Today I'm altering my website to participate in [Dean Gray Tuesday](http://americanedit.org/home/ae/). [Check out my nifty graphic, and download the music.](http://www.nemorathwald.com/) I had a whole speech planned out for this, but I'm crazy busy coming back from vacation so it'll have to wait. Edited to add: [Somebody has made a video of Dr. Who on Holiday](http://www.zippyvideos.com/8384574672657496/deangrey256k/) which looks ten times more professional than the animation I was planning. However, it does not have my visual gags like the voting booth marked TARDIS. So I might make my version anyway. , and Bill, are you still up for it? Edited again to add: I am incredibly chuffed with pride to report that Cory Doctorow liked my graphic so much he [blogged it on one of the world's biggest blogs, BoingBoing.net.](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/12/13/dean_grey_tuesday_sa.html) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/DalekRIAA.jpg)

Sounds like a really skillfully done mash-up. Though I don't care for Green Day, I listened to the Kleptones' remix of Queen + Beastie Boys, Grandmaster Flash and others almost constantly for over a year. Mash-ups are a fantastic way to get exposed to new sounds. Why doesn't the recording industry get it? ... ah, to hell with them anyway.

Nice going Matt. That's a screen shot that should go into your resume and portfolio.
