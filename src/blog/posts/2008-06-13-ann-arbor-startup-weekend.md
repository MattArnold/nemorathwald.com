[Ann Arbor Startup Weekend](http://annarbor.startupweekend.com/) is next weekend, June 20 through 22. This looks interesting and might lead to opportunities. is going, and I'm going, and now is going as well. It's a loosely-structured gathering bringing together those who know software development, user experience, legal, public relations, design, business development, and project management to form teams that create actual startups by the end of the weekend. I have no idea what I'll do or contribute, but I intend to learn something. It was Cory Doctorow's novella "[Themepunks](http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2005/09/12/themepunks_1/)" that cured me of my allergy to the word "business". I'll re-read it before I go.

Now that Barfleet Summer Games is rescheduled (it was going to be that weekend), I wonder if it would be possible to convince Chuck to take part in this adventure?
