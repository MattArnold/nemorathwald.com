left this morning on a twelve-hour car trip, for a week-long vacation with her family in Alabama. I begin an experiment in carlessness (also-- since I have delayed getting a bank account-- an experiment in making sure to get by on a set amount of cash.) My car works fine. I just can't seem to find where I put the title, so I can bring the title to get insurance, so I can bring proof of insurance to get tags. It's been nice to not have to pay those costs for a while, but the time has come to get back behind the wheel.

is on his way here to take me grocery shopping, and carpool to the Penguicon Board of Directors meeting (which is open to the public, by the way) from 1 PM to 4 PM at 5675 Big Pine Drive, Ypsilanti, MI Â 48197. One of the items on their agenda is the election of a 2009 conchair. This year we have a possibly record-setting high number of volunteers for the job who don't have to be tackled and forced to do it. That number is one. I will give you more news on this later.

You know that you can get a copy of the title reissued, right?

Also, I don't remember ever needing the title to get online insurance. You just need the VIN. Do you have a specific insurance provider that is cheaper or something?

Yah! What Rachel just said. I'm not sure you do need a title to have insurance issued. Hmmm....
