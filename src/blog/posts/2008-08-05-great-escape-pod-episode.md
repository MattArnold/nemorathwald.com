The latest episode of Escape Pod is my favorite thus far. "[How I Mounted Goldie, Saved My Partner Lori, and Sniffed Out The Peopleâ€™s Justice](http://escapepod.org/2008/08/01/ep169-how-i-mounted-goldie-saved-my-partner-lori-and-sniffed-out-the-peoples-justice/)" by Jonathan "Sullydog" Sullivan. In addition to being a science fiction author, [Sullydog](http://sullydog.com/) practices and teaches emergency medicine at Detroit Receiving Hospital and is a researcher into the causes of stroke. He's been a really cool presenter at Penguicon, including the panel about "[Brain As Computer Metaphor](http://www.archive.org/details/Brain-as-computerMetaphor_256)".
