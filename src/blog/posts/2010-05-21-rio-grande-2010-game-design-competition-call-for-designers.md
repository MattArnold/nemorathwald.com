Please forward this to any board/card game designers who you know. U-Con has submitted our proposal to host local finals for this year's Rio Grande game design competition. If Michigan is to have a chance to host a finals location, I need to tell Rio Grande's coordinator how many game designers around here are interested. I will post more details soon, but please, if there is even a conditional chance that you will be interested, contact me ASAP to let me know. If we don't have enough designers expressing interest by the end of the weekend, we will have to drive to Columbus in order to compete.

If it's here, I very well might.
