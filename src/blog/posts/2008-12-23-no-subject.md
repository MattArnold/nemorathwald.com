I realized today that the church I used to work for did not offer me a job to operate the camera for their Christmas Eve services tonight. The last time I did that for them was their Easter sunrise services. I was incredibly tired, so between services I went up to a classroom where they had a Middle-Eastern tent full of pillows, and took a nap. I got caught. That could have something to do with why they stopped giving me jobs. That's OK. I think I learned everything about myself that I wanted to learn. Speaking of learning about myself, pretty soon I'll tell you about the Christian polyamorous woman who I mentioned last week. In the meantime, I made a new userpic. ![](http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/83335699/2882778)

Well, we're going to see each other again, but I don't think it's going anywhere. I just keep hoping that when issues come up, it will be like when they passionately debate interesting points on "The West Wing" and then go to lunch together. Just one case in point: she is against abortion, but she doesn't want to impose that on others. She has two kids. "You agree with the bumper sticker then," I said, "If you don't like abortions, don't have one." She made some comments about "abortion is murder" and "joining the demonstrators", which I tried very hard to see as cute tongue-in-cheek repartee and failed. Then I watched several episodes of "The West Wing" in a row. I would like her just fine, if she were a neighbor or co-worker.

But what if the opposing-belief-fueled sex is way hot? Or are you saying that the amount of suspension of disbeliefannoyance required makes it not worth it?

So far I'm only familiar with the hotness of admiration-fueled sex. It's difficult to conceive of it coming from some other source, but I may have to try this kind. After all, I'm interested in expanding my horizons with a wider variety of life experiences.

lmao, ok, now I'm picturing a total religious flame war that ends in really hot sex. You should totally try to piss her off and antagonize everything she says while at the same time enjoying the fact that she is becoming more and more flustered. IF it works, it would be great, because whatever the emotion, sex fueled by very strong emotion is a very good thing. It can be confusing, though, just a caveat.

I would love to help. However, I don't know what you don't understand about it. Have you never heard the quote of which it is a modification?
