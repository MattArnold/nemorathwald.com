I noticed some of yesterday's laser cutter pledgers are from MakerWorks in Ann Arbor, as one of their members put this pledge drive on the Shop Mates mailing list. We now have 22 pledgers. Not even one person has filled out the "$0" option in the questionnaire yet, so who knows? If you haven't pledged zero dollars, maybe you're still going to pledge a few bucks! If you're one of those, is the two-thirds mark what you were waiting for? Because we passed the $4,000 dollar mark yesterday! $6,000, here we come! Remember, please keep spreading the word about this! We need ideas for other groups where we might be able to find pledgers. Thanks!
