Does anyone local have some Lite-Brite pegs they want to give away?

actually.. yes, we have a ton of these. Some of the newer fangled ones that also were letters, and like.. rods with two on the ends, but also the old school ones. They never worked as well as I remember them working back in the day- i think these are early 90's era ones. Let me know if those would work, I could give you at least a little bag of 'em..

They don't even need to work as Lite-Brite. The idea is to just use them as pegs. If I had even one Lite-Brite peg, I could start testing hole diameters on the laser cutter for my project. So yes, please!
