I call this meme quiz "Chromaturgy." It asks you to select from a series of color swatches based on how they make you feel. The output is unique among LJ memes in that it is pretty universally unflattering (a memetic disadvantage), and ventures bold enough to get specific. I have sometimes noticed myself being kind of mercenary-- in helping to run Penguicon for instance. I once commented that I would set aside any personal difference to get a project accomplished. In the remainder of the analysis, in those few places where Chromaturgy is accurate, it could have been a portrait of me about three years ago. The mystery relationship/situation so cleverly left unidentified here-- the better to cause [the Forer Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect)\-- could have been pretty much any home, work, or family relationship from that time. As for the references to escapism into an idealized environment of the imagination, I relate to this completely.

Matt took the free ColorQuiz.com personality test!

_"Longs for sensitive and sympathetic understanding ..."_

[Click here](http://www.colorquiz.com/cgi-bin/results.cgi?do=print_blog&picked1=6,2,3,5,7,4,1,0,5&picked2=5,0,2,7,6,3,4,1,7&sex=Male&blog_name=Matt) to read the rest of the results.

_Matt's Existing Situation Pursues his objectives and his own-self-interest with stubborn determination; refuses to compromise or make concessions. Matt's Stress Sources An emotional relationship is no longer running smoothly, has proven deeply disappointing, and is now regarded as a depressing tie. While on one hand, he would like to free himself from this attachment altogether, yet, on the other, he does not want to lose anything nor risk uncertainty and the possibility of further disappointment. These contradictory emotions aggravate him to such an extent that he tries to suppress them beneath an aloof and severe attitude. Matt's Restrained Characteristics Feels trapped in a distressing or uncomfortable situation and seeking some way of gaining relief. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity providing no turmoil or emotional agitation is involved. Matt's Desired Objective Longs for sensitive and sympathetic understanding and wants to protect himself against argument, conflict, or any exhausting stresses. Matt's Actual Problem Anxiety and a restless dissatisfaction, either with circumstances or with unfulfilled emotional requirements, have produced considerable stress. He tries to escape into an idealized atmosphere of sympathy and understanding, or into a substitute environment of estheticism and beauty. Matt's Actual Problem #2 Disappointment and the fear that there is no point in formulating fresh goals have led to anxiety, and he is distressed by the lack of any close and understanding relationship. He attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as he desires them to be._

I'd be fascinated to see the methodology that they are using to generate this. In the sample I've seen so far, it's nailed some particularly deep issues in all the subjects (including myself). I don't think your's is entirely accurate, but then again, you are much more inclined towards printed confrontation than face to face.

[This page,](http://primal-page.com/luscher.htm) while admittedly being part of a website called "Regression Therapy Books Index," offers more detail: _The test consists of eight variously-colored cards with a numeral on the reverse side. The cards are randomly placed color side up in front of the person to be tested who is asked to chose the color card which he finds most attractive. This card is then placed color side down above the remaining seven cards. Each card, in descending order of subjective attractiveness is subsequently chosen until the cards are in a row with the color side facing down with the numerals appearing on the back of the cards. The row of cards are divided into pairs and each pair of colors is interpreted in various tables in the book._

I selected colors randomly, and the results still apply. I would bet that further tests would provide similiar results. The interesting thing is that results upon first flush seem intimate, but are in reality generalities wrapped in more generality.

I actually found my results to be pretty off-base. They described an assertive person who was plagued by being too driven. In actuality, I consider myself pretty meek and, if anything, am too apathetic for my own good.
