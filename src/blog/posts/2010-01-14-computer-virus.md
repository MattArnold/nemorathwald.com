Installing Flash resulted in a flurry of virus, Trojan, worm, and rootkit attacks on my system. I cancelled the install. My antivirus detected most of the malware. But according to the warning announcement on my new wallpaper, something got through. I'm scanning the whole system with Avast now.

If you detect virut, you have real problems. Dr. Web Live CD is your only hope.

If you have active malware, you can also try this tool to shut it down so you can then remove it. (Untested by me, but reported by a reliable site.) http://www.technibble.com/rkill-repair-tool-of-the-week/
