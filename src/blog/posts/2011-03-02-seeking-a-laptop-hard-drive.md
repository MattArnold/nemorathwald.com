I was donated an Inspiron 9300 with a defective screen and no hard drive, to tinker around with. Anybody have an ATA drive they want to give away? EDITED TO ADD: It's a laptop.

How big do you want? I might have one I can spare.

I'd need 30 or 40 gig if I'm to install Ubuntu on it and still have space for some files.

Not sure if it's the right type drive, but you can check it out and see. Have a couple of Seagate Barracuda 7200 80 GB drives sitting around. Let me know if one of them will work for you.

From what I can tell, Barracuda 7200s are not laptop drives. Thanks though!
