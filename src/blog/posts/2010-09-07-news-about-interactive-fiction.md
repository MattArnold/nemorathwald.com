1\. I've been invited to teach a workshop this Saturday evening at the hackerspace [i3Detroit](http://www.i3detroit.com/), on how to write Interactive Fiction with [InForm](http://inform7.com/). This will follow the screening of the documentary [GET LAMP](http://www.getlamp.com/) at 3 PM. 2. At Readercon, Andrew Plotkin gave a wonderful talk titled "[A Writer's Guide To Interactive Fiction](http://eblong.com/zarf/essays/if-for-writers.html)". 3. In a tremendous breakthrough for Interactive Fiction, you can now **play it in your web browser**. Actually, that's been done for a long time. But now, you can _save_ your game, _without_ login, just by telling it "SAVE" and then bookmarking the resulting URL. Download nothing. Install nothing. Log in to nothing. Just go to [The People's Republic of Interactive Fiction](http://pr-if.org/play/) and play. There is really no excuse anymore. The only reason for you to not play Interactive Fiction is if you don't want to. If you don't want to experiment with an innovative, emotionally strange way to deliver prose fiction, that's OK! You will probably want to avoid [Photopia](http://pr-if.org/play/photopia/) then. Read a nice orderly book. If you would prefer your psychological horror to not play on your own participation, do not play [Shade](http://pr-if.org/play/shade/). Instead, why don't you read a horror story or novel? So much less likely to mess with your head. If you can't even think of the first thing to do in [Lost Pig](http://pr-if.org/play/lostpig/): What would you do when trying to locate something in the dark? Not "What is a video game character able to do?" What would you do in real life?

Ooh!! Is the screening and workshop invite only, fee-based, or open to the general public? If I'm not in Flint, this looks like it could be awesome!
