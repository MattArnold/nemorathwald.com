I suddenly have a new computer! For free, of course, as they all are. (Wait long enough, look in the right places, and manufacture luck through social networking, and spending money is often unnecessary. In money as in so many other aspects of life, waiting and watching is one of my superpowers.) Yesterday the [Lojban User Group](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=southeast+Michigan+Lojban+group) met at my house. On our way back from a Vietnamese/Thai restaurant, Nick suddenly slammed on the brakes. A pile of four computers sat in a trash pile on the curb. After we got them home we discovered they work fine, and were state-of-the-art 2002! Nick took three and I took one, with a 160GB Seagate hard drive and three 256MB sticks of RAM. I'm thinking I'll use it for an Ubuntu server as I learn web development with [Python](http://www.python.org/) under theÂ [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. (I'm just not ready to use the [TurboGears](http://turbogears.com/) framework yet.)

Amazing what people will throw away, eh?

Perhaps it's the voyeur in me, but I always get a kick out of looking through the HDD of "thriftstore" computers. It's not that I'm looking for anything dirty or whatever, just always interesting to see how other people store their stuff (and, of course, _what_ they store).

Conan, what is best? To find treasure that others have foolishly discarded as worthless. Also, to slay my foes with a Cat5e o' Nine Tails.
