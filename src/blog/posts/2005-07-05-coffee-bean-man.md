According the the site I got this picture from: _"Doctors have concluded that if you find the man hiding in the coffee beans in three seconds that the right half of your brain is better developed than that of most people. If you find the man between three seconds and one minute, then the right half of your brain is developed normally. If you find the man between one minute and three minutes, then the right half of your brain is functioning slowly and you need to eat more protein. If you have not found the man after three minutes the right half of your brain is a mess, and the only advice is to look more for these types of exercises to make that part of the brain stronger. The man is really there."_ You've got to concentrate on the details to get it fast. I think Coffee Bean Man looks kind of like James Gandolfini.
