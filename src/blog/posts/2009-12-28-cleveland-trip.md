\- I'm in Cleveland this week. I made it in before the snow fell. I'll return briefly, only to go to Indiana for the weekend. - There is no internet or mobile phone access in this apartment, but there is in the library, and it is practically next door. - Yesterday I tried a new substance. It had no effect on me that I could detect, except for the pain. - There is a vintage 80s toy store here. What a blast from the past!

The pain? was the substance supposed to be fun?

Yeah, it was. I can see the subtitle now:

**FUN you're doing it wrong**
