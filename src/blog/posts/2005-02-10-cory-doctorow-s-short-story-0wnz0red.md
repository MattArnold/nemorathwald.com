[_0wnzored_ is from Cory Doctorow's collection _A Place So Foreign and Eight More._](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/28/0wnz0red/) I love it because it expresses the direct connection between the hacker culture and transhumanism. For that matter, depending how far you want to take the "root-level superuser of your own body" idea and extend it to the mind, it expresses the potential connection between those two and technopaganism. Though the story is fiction, "Honorable Computing," described in _0wnz0red_ as "your basic Bond-villain world-domination horseshit," is real. The characters talk about "the Senator from Disney who wants to make computers illegal"-- this is Fritz Hollings, as the story says, but it could also be Orrin Hatch. Hatch believes in creating legislation allowing content providers to do malicious computer intrusion to spy on any computer that they think has copyrighted content. With no oversight, no due-process. Just the company deciding behind closed doors in a smoky room. Another idea Hatch supports is to allow corporations to decide (again with no oversight) to [destroy the computers of people caught stealing music.](http://www.macobserver.com/columns/thebackpage/2003/20030618.shtml) World-Domination Bond Villian? Yes. In the vision of the entertainment industries and the legislators who they've bought and own, all computers would have to become like DVD players, where the industry has their proprietary code built in so that they are in total control over what you do with your property-- your computer becomes the entertainment industry's property. The industry is going into exactly the same conniptions that they did when VCRs came out and they nearly killed videotape then. 0wnz0red is published under the Creative Commons license, so the author and publisher want it to be copied far and wide. Please do so!

Plus, I already take it to heart. In my most recent collection of links, I have a link about Trusted Computing. It's a coalition between Intel, IBM, HP, and Microsoft. You should check it out. I think you will find that fact is certainly mirroring fiction.
