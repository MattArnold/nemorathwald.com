[Parodies of Buddhist Koans.](http://home.earthlink.net/~qleah/adam_hindman-koans.html)

> A student said to the chief monk, "Help me to pacify my mind!" The chief monk said, "Bring your mind over here and I will pacify it." The student said, "But I don't know where my mind is!" The monk replied, "Then I have already pacified it." The student said, "Explain to me in detail what you have just done." The chief monk was silent. The student said, "Well?" The monk hung his head, saying, "I tried to confuse you so that you would go away."

The student said to the master: "Does a dog have Buddha-nature?" And the master said: "Do you?" And the student said: "Ah, yes! I see!" And the master said: "Then you are a dog."
