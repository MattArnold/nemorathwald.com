Today was the day I was going to replace my car starter. I have not touched it for a couple of weeks while I waited to get paid from an assignment. But I decided to try the ignition one more time. I discovered its behavior has changed, so that now the starter is engaging. Previously the electricity all came on, but there was no sound, not even the clicking sound coming from the starter solenoid. Today the starter makes this rythm: "DAdadadaDAdadadaDAdadadaDAdadada." The engine makes its normal "whoomph" sound for the tiniest fraction of a second and then dies, even if I push down the accelerator. The dashboard "FUEL CUTOUT" indicator lights up. So now I no longer know what to replace. I may have to take it to a mechanic, but that is a serious last resort. Any advice?

If you can rip the starter out, most auto supply stores (Murray's comes to mind) will test it for free.

Are you sure your battery isn't low? Put it on a charger, or better, jump it with another idling car. If your battery is low at 10 volts it would behave exactly as you describe.

Could the timing belt of been knocked out of place in the process of tinkering with other functions? Did it run complete dry of fuel shortly before this issue started? After the "Fuel Cutout" light, did you try disconnecting the battery for 10+ minutes before trying again? Do you hear a whurring sound when the ignition is turned to "ON" (but not "Start")? BTW, are you still in Ypsi? Next week's the last of school for the summer and I have a month off in which I could assist. If you could give me the make, model, year, and if you know it, engine size, I could do some more research on this issue in the meantime.

I'm in Ypsilanti up until this weekend. After that I will continue to return for another week to take the last stuff and clean the vacated apartment. Today the car abruptly started running again!
