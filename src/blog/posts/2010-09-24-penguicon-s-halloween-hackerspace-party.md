Penguicon's Halloween Hackerspace party, on Oct. 30, at 8PM through 2AM, needs volunteers! Cleaning up, serving drinks, and making and serving liquid nitrogen ice cream. Let me know if you'd like to participate, and if you're available before, during, or after!

Or, you all could come to the Aegis party, at the same time, and bring drinks and socialise with a bunch of like minded people, and get Two Victory Points to boot! http://pics.livejournal.com/ssanfratello/pic/00002h0y/
