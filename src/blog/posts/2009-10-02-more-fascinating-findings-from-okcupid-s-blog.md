Good grief, I love OKCupid's blog so much. They've done it again. They do so much cool data analysis and infographics about relationships and demographics, that you can't look away, even if you hate their service (and I don't, I think it's great). Here they go again with their findings on [How Races And Religions Match In Online Dating](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/29/how-races-and-religions-match-in-online-dating/). One thing they found is further indication, if any were needed, that astrological signs make absolutely no difference at all. Also in the "not news" department-- they found that the more seriously you take your position on the topic of religion, the more of a wallop you take to your popularity. The interesting part is, and I'm quoting:

> even a man who’s “very serious" about his religion and has presumably designed his matching algorithm around this fact is _still_ more compatible with the women who are laughing about it.

Until next time, dear readers, I leave you with this Mad Lib: ["How’s it going? I’m a curious kinda awkward atheist whose favorite movies and video games all involve tatooed zombies in a metal band. I noticed that you mention the pretty good taste of vegetarian physics and probably awesome grad school literature. lol. Sorry!"](http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/14/online-dating-advice-exactly-what-to-say-in-a-first-message/)
