I hadn't previously heard of a few of the speakers at [Stanford's Singularity Summit](http://sss.stanford.edu/), but I know every single one of the following eight names, and it's the most exciting lineup of Guests of Honor ever. It's interesting to finally find out from their photos what some of them look like. - Ray Kurzweil, inventor, futurist, author of "The Singularity Is Near" - Douglas Hofstadter, cognitive scientist, author of "Gödel, Escher, Bach" - K. Eric Drexler, nanotechnology pioneer, author of "Engines of Creation" - Nick Bostrom, director of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute - Cory Doctorow, science fiction author, blogger, technology activist - Eliezer Yudkowski, Director and Research Fellow, Singularity Institute - Christine Peterson, VP Public Policy, Foresight Nanotech Institute - Tyler Emerson, Executive Director, Singularity Institute The "What others have said" section shows Marvin Minsky, Hans Moravec, Vernor Vinge, Ben Goertzel, Jamais Cascio and Jaron Lanier. I wonder if they'll be at the summit? That section also lists Bill Gates, Bill Joy and Stephen Hawking. But it's not a science fiction convention, it's an academic conference. These aren't really Guests of Honor, because that implies the presence of their fans at the event. This is by RSVP only. That's fine-- it's important that specialist professionals gather to do valuable work on the problems and promises of the Singularity in peace. That having been said, it would also be fantastic to get any of these to speak at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org), especially since it's a Linux and Open Source software expo in addition to a science fiction convention. Many of them would probably demand an appearance fee, which all-volunteer not-for-profit SF conventions don't pay. And many of them probably would not want to be seen to be associated with a science fiction event (except for Cory Doctorow, who [has already been our Guest of Honor](http://pc3.penguicon.org/guests/goh/cory)). But Christine Peterson says in her Singularity Summit promotional blurb "If you're trying to project the long-term future, and what you get sounds like science fiction, you might be wrong. But if it doesn't sound like science fiction, it's _definitely_ wrong." I enjoyed reading the comment by Glenn Harlan Reynolds, Professor of Law, University of Tennessee, which is extremely signifigant to me as a non-specialist: _I want to focus on a different aspect of Ken MacLeod's 'Rapture of the Nerds' comment, because I actually think it cuts both ways. Yes, it's possible to draw parallels between the Christian idea of The Rapture — and, even more generally, between religious ideas of transcendence generally — and the notion that, once human technology passes a certain threshold, roughly that described by Vinge and other singularity enthusiasts, human beings will potentially enjoy the kind of powers and pleasures traditionally assigned to gods or beings in heaven: Limitless lifespans, if not immortality, superhuman powers, virtually limitless wealth, fleshly pleasures on demand, etc. These do sound like the sorts of things that religions have promised their followers throughout human history. That leads some who invoke MacLeod's comment to contend that because singularity enthusiasts hope for the same kinds of things that religious believers have hoped for, singularity enthusiasts are merely adherents to a new sort of religion, the religion of science. But as Isaac Asimov has noted, the religion of science is distinguished by one chief characteristic: 'that it works.' I express no opinion on whether science will actually deliver on these hopes. But I note that people once looked to supernatural sources for such now-mundane things as cures for baldness or impotence, only to find those desires satisfied, instead, by modern pharmacology. Yet that hardly makes those who place their faith in pharmacology members of a religion — or, if it does, it makes them members of a religion that is distinguishable from those dependent on the supernatural._

Minsky came to Fusion and had a fabulous time. I bet he could be convinced to come to Penguicon...

A lot of these guys would probably attend a con as a Science GoH. Can't hurt to ask.

I agree. Send out some invitations. Cristine Peterson especially sounds like an interesting guest. :-)

I could put in a good word with Ben Goertzel. (I was his room-mate in college. He's weird. Like, weirder than fans.)

Well, we've already invited Bruce Schneier for this year as a tech GoH. Gee, Matt, if you were to be con chair for next year, you could invite the GoH's you want. (\*nudge\* \*nudge\* \*wink\* \*wink\*).

Yes, but think "crossover appeal." Mr. Schneier is a great attendance draw with perfect geek cred, but he doesn't do futurics so far as I know. He isn't working on biotech, nanotech or artificial intelligence. My opinion is that an appeal that spans present-day tech with cutting-edge research does not throw off the balance. At the least, what about having a futurist for a Nifty Guest?
