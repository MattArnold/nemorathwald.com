[This is the PDF for the program I designed for PyOhio.](http://drop.io/PyOhioProgram) It's Ohio's regional conference about Python, a free and open source programming language. It takes place Saturday of this week. Alas, I will not be able to attend due to conflicts. The program is to be printed on one double-sided 11"x17" sheet and folded twice.
