Programmers! The Logical Language Group, LLC, of which I am President, is offering $500 for the creation of a CFG (Context-Free Grammar) or BNF (Backus-Naur form, or formal notation) for [Lojban](http://nemorathwald.com/aboutlojban) that includes the elidable terminators, using whatever parser generator of your choice. Feel free to build on the BNF [here](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Lojban+Formal+Grammars&bl=y) or the one [here](http://www.digitalkingdom.org/~rlpowell/hobbies/lojban/grammar/lojban.abnf.txt). Currently elidable terminators are the only thing missing from the computerized version of our grammar. You know in HTML how you start with a bracketed tag, then close it off with another bracketed tag that has a slash in it? The one with a slash is a terminator. Lojban speaks those out loud to close off grammar structures (clauses, phrases, and so forth) to prevent ambiguity. "Elidable" means the ones that a Lojban speaker is permitted to leave out if desired. Our current parsers are awesome, but I think they basically just assume you've elided the terminators when you can. We offer $300 for the same thing that would encode any five elidable terminators, as long as they include "VAU" and "KU". We also offer $100 for a formal proof that encoding Lojban's elidable terminators is not possible in a CFG. Please email me for more details.
