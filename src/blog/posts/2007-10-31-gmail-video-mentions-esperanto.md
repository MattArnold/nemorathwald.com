Hey, how cool. In the new educational video, ["Spam, Time, and You"](http://www.google.com/mail/help/fightspam/getstarted.html), Google's Brad Taylor mentions [Esperanto](http://www.esperanto.net/). This will undoubtedly bring many new speakers to that artificial language, and possibly from there to the world of artificial languages in general.

Isn't Esperanto more of a "constructed" language, rather than "artificial"? After all, it uses other languages as roots ("...similar to words from Romance, Germanic or Slavic languages"), as opposed to Lojiban, which (as far as I know) isn't based on any particular language, or group of languages.

Can any language be truly original?
