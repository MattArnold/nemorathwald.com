requested the English version of "I Am A Little Teapot of Borg" as a ringtone. I translated "I'm A Little Teapot" into Lojban, and this sound file ([click here to download the MP3](http://www.nemorathwald.com/jbocradi/cmatipaxmusic.mp3)) is what I got when I translated it back into English. I'm not sure who laughs harder at this, or . It might just be funnier than the Sesame Street theme song translated into Klingon. (I order you to immediately tell me the way to Sesame Street!) Resistance is futile. You _will_ hear me shout. You _will_ be tipped over and poured into Borg.

It's so weird that "spout" seems so broad--- how do you define ducted vs. ductless glands? Okay, it was pretty funny...
