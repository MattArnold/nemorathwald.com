Last year conservatives made a big deal about a supposed "War On Christmas" because some private business choose of their own free will not to participate in publicly decorating for the Christian holiday. There is a certain kind of Christian who feels persecuted if cities don't pay out my tax dollars to display Christmas creches on public streets and squares that are paid for by my tax dollars. But now witness the terrornoia reaction when some girls did a cool and fun art project for April Fools' Day. [Click here for a link to the article in the Akron Beacon-Journal](http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/14239923.htm) and [the article in the online Record-Courier](http://www.recordpub.com/article.php?pathToFile=archive/04012006/news/&file=_news1.txt&article=1&tD=04012006). I have put in a call with the Beacon-Journal's Metro Editor in charge of local news to confirm that this is not just an April Fool's Day joke on the part of the paper and that the events really happened as described. The teenage girls followed the instructions on [a cool website to make life-size Super Mario Bros. power-up blocks and spread them all over the town](http://www.qwantz.com/posterchild/). The bomb squad was called out to disarm these pinatas. According to the instructions on the website, the foil-covered cardboard boxes should contain a prize as a gift to whoever is lucky enough to find them. As anyone knows who has not lived under a rock for the last twenty years, question mark blocks traditionally dispense help and not harm. These decorations were intended to delight, not threaten. Criminal charges are being brought against the five girls ages 15 to 17. Are we now criminalizing random acts of kindness toward strangers? Some artists put up beautiful decorations for April Fool's Day, and are actually being persecuted for it. See, this is what it would actually look like in December if there were a war on Christmas. The internet is banding together to make an outcry, and pay their legal fees if this laughingstock of a case actually makes it to court. One of my favorite comments to the article was from a user named "disgusted by cowardice": "Hello Police? Yes, there have been several unidentified packages left under our Christmas tree. We saw a bearded man leaving the scene. Can you send in the bomb squad?" To which I would add, "Hello, police? Someone has made a rainbow and sprinkled it with _dew_. I feel that the security of my homeland is all tingly." The nice thing about decorating a public place with privately-funded question blocks is that the first person to find them is supposed to destroy them. If people put out their own privately-funded manger scenes which yield coins, flowers and mushroom-shaped chocolates when smashed with baseball bats, I'd be all in favor of it. Sounds like a fun holiday season.

I'm not certain they can be charged with a crime. It is not illegal to leave empty boxes laying around. Maybe littering?

_To which I would add, "Hello, police? Someone has made a rainbow and sprinkled it with dew. I feel that the security of my homeland is all tingly."_ Snrk. You have a way with words, Matthew. ;)

Honestly, if I saw a box like that laying around I would not know what to think. Not being a big video game player, I would certainly call a foil-covered box with a big question mark on it a "suspicious package". Given that a lot of people out there are even more unfamiliar with Super Mario than I, it's understandable that this stunt would raise some alarm. I know they meant to have fun, and I used to do stuff like this, too. They should be made to understand how their actions might be interpreted, not by pressing charges, though. Maybe a judge should discuss it with them and their parents, then make them go out and clean up the mess.
