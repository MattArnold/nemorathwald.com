Minutes ago, I was in the final elimination round of the Dominion tournament. I was in a 3-player rather than 4-player game, so that was easier on us. The cards were mostly from the Seaside expansion, which my opponents had never played, and which I've been playing for years. I noticed they both bought Outposts, widely considered one of the worst cards in the game. I used Ambassador to put my least useful cards into my opponents' decks, and Salvager to recycle the rest for money. This left me with a tiny powerhouse deck of cards into which I put two Treasure Maps, and used Haven to store them so they came up together. The Treasure Maps put four Golds on top of my discard pile. My opponents complimented me on these fancy stunts and said they were in awe. We all agreed I had the game in the bag. But when the score was counted, I lost by four points. It took too long to set up all those flashy stunts, and I wasn't able to catch up on their early lead. But no matter! I won the new base card reprints with gorgeous illustrations! I got into the elimination round! It's been an incredible day.

Do you remember what the rest of the cards in the final set were? I must say, I'm surprised that the final game in a regional qualifier would have people who had not played with all of the cards.

Ambassador, Chancellor, Embargo, Haven, Lighthouse, Moat, Outpost, Salvager, Treasure Map, and Village.

Yeah, that's a strong kingdom for Ambassador. Outpost could be effective combined with Haven, but there's not enough draw to make the 3-card hands really useful. I think I'd open Ambassador/Lighthouse. (Typonote: I think you meant Treasure Map put the Gold on your deck, not your discard pile)
