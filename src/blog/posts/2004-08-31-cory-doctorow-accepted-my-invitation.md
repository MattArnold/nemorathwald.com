[Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com/bio.html) has replied to my e-mail inviting him to Penguicon 3.0. Not only is he willing to be our honored guest, he's so enthusiastic he's already suggested a half-dozen schedule events! I can't describe how geeked I am about this without lapsing into Lojban. [Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com/bio.html) is European Affairs Coordinator for the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.net/). He is author of two of my personal all-time favorite novels, [_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_](http://craphound.com/down/) and [_Eastern Standard Tribe_](http://craphound.com/est/). He is the winner of the 2003 Locus Award for Best First Novel, and the 2000 John W Campbell Award for Best New Writer. He was also a 2003 Nebula nominee. [_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_](http://craphound.com/down/) concerns a reputation economy in a future of immortality and no physical need, where ad-hocracies (very similar to SF convention committees) have taken over Walt Disney World as a hobby. [_Eastern Standard Tribe_](http://craphound.com/est/) is about internet tribes based on time zones and involves digital rights management and the choice between smarts and happiness. All are distributed for free under the Creative Commons License, which is to art and literature what the Open Source License is to software. Read them for free! And like me, you might run out and buy them just to vote with your wallet. Don't make me hold you down and download them into your pocket computer by force! The next novel, _Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town_ (forthcoming in February 2005) is a contemporary fantasy novel about open WiFi networking, set in Toronto's Kensington Market. He co-edits the weblog Boing Boing (boingboing.net) a popular blog with millions of monthly readers, and is a regular contributor to Wired Magazine, Popular Science, Business 2.0 and other magazines and newspapers. Though he resides in London, UK, Cory is a native Torontonian, and while there, he co-founded OpenCola, an open-source P2P company that was sold last year to Toronto's OpenText, Inc. In addition to software it sold an actual beverage with a public recipe that anyone could make, as an analogy with open source.

Penguicon will be sooo cool. He sounds like a fascinating person. I can't wait. Glad you have an enthusiastic guest. :-) Go ahead. Feel free to lapse into Lojban....

He wants to do a reading, give a talk on digital rights management, and participate in panels on 1) the hidden fascist assuptions in _I, Robot_; 2) Folk Art, Fandom and Copyright; and 3) unlimited spectrum and cognitive radio. Plus he'll play the role of Eddie in the live _Rocky Horror Picture Show._ His girlfriend Alice Taylor (http://crystaltips.typepad.com/) will be a nifty because she was a pro gamer on England's national _Quake_ team, so she'll do panels on computer gaming and compete in the Celebrity Frag Fest. Plus she will be in the live _Buffy, the Musical._

Wow! Cory sounds like an awesome guest! I've heard about him before, just not described as enthusiastically as you've described him. :) /me must pick up one of his books, and thinks I'll start off with Eastern Standard Tribe -Kare

So, question. You mentioned that Cory Doctorow is now living in England. Will he and his S.O. be willing to travel cattle class? Just remembering what it cost to bring Terry over in business class. (shudder). Also, is he still technically Canadian? That should help, as I believe the US has instigated some pretty draconian visa requirements, such as showing up in person at the US embassy. Which for the UK, means going to London for the day (not as great a problem for Cory as for someone who lives in the more distant reaches of the Isles.) We'll cross the travel bridge when we get there...

Shall I post this as an announcement?

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Aug. 31, 2004 6:50 PM

No, please. Thanks for offering. I've got the announcement written out and ready, but one of the facts in it isn't true for another day or two.

OK, I posted it!

Neat! Now where's my invitation? :) -=ShoEboX=-

Does this mean that Penguicon has a hotel, and has picked solid dates? 2005 is filling up already....
