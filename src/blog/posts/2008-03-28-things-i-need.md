I would like to purchase the following things, or their equivalents, at garage-sale prices.

These things already sell for under $10 at Meijer: ![](http://images.netshops.com/mgen/digimarc.ms?img=master:CSC007.jpg&h=300&w=300)

Oh wow, cool. I thought it would be way more than that.

**[ext_1013271](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_1013271)** on Mar. 28, 2008 4:12 PM

I think I may have an extra ![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZJJlQF1bL._SS260_.jpg), but will need to check if I was hallucinating or not. How much ![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Z2-0yjoWL._SS260_.jpg) would you need?

**[ext_1013271](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_1013271)** on Mar. 28, 2008 4:12 PM

Wait, is that a candle warmer or a hotplate?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 4:15 PM

It's a hot plate. I only need one ethernet cable, about five or six feet in length.

If you only need one, you're out of luck, because I've got at least half a dozen that you can have. Also I think I might have a clamp-light like that, too. I'll look around.

I'm pretty sure hotplate #3 belongs to James. And hotplate #1 was kept and sold by my ex-boyfriend. This leaves us with hotplate #2. It belongs to fraggedone, his decision. I think we have an extra ![](http://lnt.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/p1106907reg.jpg) but it was an older model. I'll check if we've already found a new home for it or not. As for... ![](http://graphics.samsclub.com/images/products/0078931316652_LG.jpg) If he wants the old wok (no longer non-stick but not and issue with the right spray) he can have it for free (I'm sick of hitting myself on the handle every time I reach in the cabinet).

How soon would you need the futon, and does it have to be that exact style? Because I'm working move-out week and might, not certain, be able to get one for free that was thrown away.

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 5:00 PM

There's no hurry. It does not have to be similar even remotely, in any way. Thanks!

I think I have a ![](http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/yhst-4829792992329_1993_22337628) you can have. I don't tend to use them compared to my sister's halogen work lamp that I seem to have inherited... Have you posted on freecycle what you're looking for, btw?

![](http://www.girlscoutsofblackhawk.org/Portals/0/webphotos/thanks.jpg) Even though I have ![](http://sbdrichard.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/yard-sale-bw.jpg) that I would happily give away, it's only on an intermittent rather than constant basis. So I don't use ![](http://www.danaroc.com/images/ezine_pics_050106_websites.jpg) because paying attention to it would be too demanding of ![](http://trond.weblogg.no/valg/images/bush_hard_work_rosie_1180703546.jpg).

**[ext_13495](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_13495)** on Mar. 28, 2008 6:11 PM

OH, I don't pay attention to it. But other people do. I post there when I have something to give away and then I get direct email back. Similarly it seems worthwhile to post when you have something specific you're looking for, like a cot. there's a format for that, at least on Ann Arbor recycle.

I have a travel hairdryer that I never use.

Try Value World (use to be Value Village), and the Salivation Army thrift stores.

wow, not having breaks between user comments is extremly annoing. but i'm generally the type who, when the rare occasions he uses myspace or lj, loathes customization that is forced apoun me. one of the many reasons i don't like such web site and vastly prefer email. any ways, ALL OF YOU should already know this by now but i am the ![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Z2-0yjoWL._SS260_.jpg) GOD! if any of you need ANY cable of ANY length, TELL ME. i scrap out these things like mad from jobs. they send me in to rip out perfectly good old ones and replace with different color. best way to make sure i see any replys to this is of course to email me.

A ![](http://lnt.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/p1106907reg.jpg)? How very metrosexual... I'm profoundly disappointed in you! :P

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 10:54 PM

It (and the hot plate, and the saucepan) is for mixing molten plasticine to make new colors, or to get the dirt out of it. Is that better?

---

**[ext_53902](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_53902)** on Mar. 28, 2008 10:58 PM

Heh, I picked the wrong pic... I love my mixer and hotplate... for.. umm.. manly things. You're going to SMOS tonight?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 11:01 PM

I've already been here for half an hour.

---

**[ext_53902](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_53902)** on Mar. 28, 2008 11:04 PM

Oh, how do I get there? I just emailed limey for dirs.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 11:11 PM

He's cooking, so I've emailed his address to you for him.

**[ext_53902](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_53902)** on Mar. 28, 2008 10:56 PM

Damnit, I was going for ![](http://www.circuitcity.com/IMAGE/product/detail/hnt/EC.HNT.RV402.JPG) this one.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 28, 2008 10:57 PM

Uh... that's for... that's for... yeah.

I have a blow dryer I don't need that I'd be willing to give you for $0. Let me know if you want me to bring it to Penguicon.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 29, 2008 11:50 AM

Yes please. Thank you!

---

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Mar. 30, 2008 9:45 PM

You're welcome. See you at Penguicon.

Black and Decker Cordless drill, honestly known as "The gutless wonder". Likely needs new batteries, will toss in the snake light and detail sander that use the same batteries and the charger of course, if we can find them.

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Mar. 29, 2008 11:55 AM

Thanks very much.
