I wonder if a career change is possible. Other people have career plans and goals, but I've never considered my career to be a source of enrichment, just a means of paying for all those things that do matter to me. Every time I care about something I usually volunteer, or give it away for free. My greatest passions are in fields that just don't have enough paid work to go around to the legions of hobbyist devotees. Nevertheless. Do I really want to be a pencil pusher the rest of my life, going through the motions of tasks with purposes I can't even fathom? I wonder if there's work to be had in teaching... I could be an excellent teacher! I could change lives! I wonder what it would take to get into it? I can't get a second college degree from scratch, but perhaps it would only take some certification courses or something. It's unfortunate that my bachelor's degree is un-accredited. Ideally, the dream job would be teaching courses in critical thinking skills. But I don't care what it is as long as it's not teaching some drab topic like math. Maybe there are some kids whose math teacher inspired them, but mine certainly didn't. How could anyone, with such a topic? I'll never forget my high school teachers in art, astronomy and critical thinking. Now those would be good subjects. Naturally, I know that teachers don't earn enough money to make a living, but I've got to consider my priorities on a day like today.

Well, I always had great Math teachers. I don't know how, but I ended up minoring in Math in college. That's gotta count for something. If you're thinking about going back to school, I'd recommend looking into taking CLEP tests. Most colleges accept the results as credit toward classes. I took one in English Composition, and passed. And I'm not even a very good writer. More info on [CLEP exams](http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/clep/about.html)

I've got to tell Rachel about these CLEP exams, because Oakland University is where she's completing her college degree, and it's on the list of schools that accept CLEP credit. Maybe it's not so impossible to get a whole new degree after all. I had a lousy geometry teacher in public high school. He was certainly the exception to the teachers there. This one hated his job and hated the students, and said so frequently.

You enjoy critical thinking? Who'da thunk it...

Matt, If I listed the top 10 stupidest people I've ever known they would all be teachers. They were small minded, narrow, uniformed, process-oriented, psychotic about order, bitter, hateful, disillusioned, cynical. Even if you were a fantastic teacher, how could you stand being around most of the rest of them? Not that I didn't have a couple of good teachers, but for the most part they were losers who took the job for 3 reason: June, July and August. gordo

I can think of some people who'd apply your list of adjectives to me, can't you? But at any rate, that's not my experience with teachers, but no doubt they're out there. I did have one that was like that. I didn't know it was possible to guarantee good co-workers just by picking an industry. The important thing is the great value of a line of work that you would do anyway without being paid. From your own experience with me, wouldn't you say I end up lecturing people anyway?

My dad just retired after 32 years of teaching. He is getting his Masters in medical physics... so, it is never too late to switch careers. If it is something you really want to do I say go for it. k
