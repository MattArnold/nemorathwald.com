I was interviewed for an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education. [Click here to read it.](http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i29/29a04001.htm) It's a shocking expose, although I expected it to be even more shocking. My comments were edited to sound much, much more sympathetic to the school and its followers than I am. It's appropriate that the reporter keep a journalistically neutral tone and let the facts speak of the outrage for themselves. Many of the prospective students will look at the cult depicted in the article as an acceptable or even wonderful educational choice. Nevertheless I believe it will change a lot of undecided minds. It will have been worth it if the article can persuade even one student not to attend. Even if the institution they choose is a religious school, when a student has the kind of religious passion that is willing to consider Pensacola Christian College, they make a great deal of personal growth merely by abstaining from groveling before theocrats. Attendance at an accredited religious college is the most we can expect. There is much more to be said about my alma mater, but I've said most of it [in my essay "Why Not To Attend PCC."](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Not_to_Choose_PCC.htm) I'll make an additional blog post later on with more thoughts about the article.

Wow, that was a very interesting (and shocking) article.

It is a good thing you got out before the brain washing took hold.

"Making eye babies" ...? That is so pitifully hilarious I can barely contain myself. "Pensacola Christian College is "an idea that came from God," according to its Web site. The college was founded in 1974 by Arlin Horton, who remains its president." That wasn't God. Horton heard a Who.

Somehow, I find myself comparing some of the details in that article to the details in the Rolling Stones article on scientology. The world can be a spooky place, and humans can be a thousand times spookier.

That was really horrifying.

Considering your rants on PCC, the author really toned you down. I wonder how much he toned down everyone else? Or maybe he just decided to focus on stories that would be of greater personal impact to potential students. However, the whole book publishing industry that they have there is the interesting (and frightening) part. Despite being iconoclasts to the rest of the xtian college network, they appear to be supplying everyone with school books. That's the real blood supply to the organization, and that's what needs to be cut off to kill it.

This piece, and the one above, introduced me to your journal. (Welcome to the f-list) I just barely dodged the bullet of PCC when I was fresh out of high school, and did go to an ABeka using elementary school that left me a semester behind - but that's another gripe. But it did seem like in that school where the curriculum was used, that the informant culture was treated as natural. I haven't had a look at the teaching material, and haven't seen the books in years, but I'd like to analyze them for that sort of subtext. Just randomly. Anyhow, "Hello!"

Wow. Just... wow. It amazes me that some religious people want to honor the god they say created human beings by eliminating the things that are part of the essential and positive nature of humans... like loving interaction and self-expression.
