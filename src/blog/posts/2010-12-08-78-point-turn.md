Last night, playing Dominion with Eric and Rob, I scored 78 points in one turn! To call this a personal best is an understatement. A six-point turn is considered a lot. I chained some cards that let me play two more cards each. I played 3 King's Courts. [King's Court](http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/?card=kingscourt) lets you pick a card from your hand and play it three times. Each of these King's Courts played a Bridge. [Bridge](http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/?card=bridge) gives you $1, lets you split your money between two cards this turn instead of being limited to buying one, and it makes the cost of all cards $1 cheaper. Three Bridges, each having been triplicated by King's Court, gave me +$9, +9 buys, and all cards cost $9 less than normal (but not less than $0). I also played $4 worth of Treasure from my hand, coming to $13. [Colonies](http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/?card=colony) are the big bad boo-yah daddy of the game, giving 10 victory points each and costing $11. But the Bridges made them only cost $2. With 6 of my Buys, I bought six of them for $12. [Provinces](http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/?card=province) give 6 points each. They cost $8, so the Bridges made them free. I used my last 3 Buys to buy 3 of them for $0. 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 78 points in one turn.

Nicely done. My best to date was somewhere in the high 40s; that was before Prosperity came out using essentially the same method with [Throne Room](http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/?card=throneroom) and Bridge.
