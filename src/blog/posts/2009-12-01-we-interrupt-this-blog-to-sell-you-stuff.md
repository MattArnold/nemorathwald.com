Happy cyber Monday! I don't mind promoting things that I like, and fortunately, I am in the business of selling stuff that I like. I hear-tell you like stuff sometimes? I am shipping a lot for Christmas, such as the shirts and CDs/DVDs pictured (politely below the cut). I'd be happy to throw another bag on the sleigh for you on my way to the post office. If you are the Christmas-celebrating sort, I can get it shipped in time to arrive for Christmas if you place your order by Friday morning. And then you would be celebrating Jesus's fake birthday by giving me _the gift of income!_ If you're not a Christmas-celebrating type, I can relate, but I assure you the stuff still works, with or without the pressure and stress of the holidays. Or maybe you like a different winter holiday? It still works! It's multi-functional. **T-Shirts**
