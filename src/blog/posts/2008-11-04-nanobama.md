[nanobama.com](http://nanobama.com/): vote for science ![](http://nanobama.com/Ofield1_small.jpg) [From electriclaserpeople.com:](http://electriclaserpeople.blogspot.com/2008/11/na-na-na-na-na-na.html)

> John Hart, and his team of nanofabbers made these little faces from carbon nanotubes, tiny hollow cylinders of carbon that are tens of thousands of times thinner than a human hair, yet several times stiffer and stronger than steel. Besides being great little campaign giveaways for the nano-scale voting block, John says, "carbon nanotubes and other nanostructures are building blocks for many important technological advances, including high-performance solar cells and batteries, new methods of diagnosing and treating disease, next-generation computer processors and memory, and lightweight composite materials." That's nanochange we can believe in.

I say, it's full of sincerity right down to the molecular level. Remember to vote today!
