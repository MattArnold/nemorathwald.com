It was a good weekend. There were panels on incorporating, getting 501c3 non-profit status and hotel contracts. Scary stuff. I don't think [Iconoclasm](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/iConoclasm.htm) will need a lot of the legalese yet. There was also fun stuff like incorporating tolerance of diversity, or how to decide what panel discussions to have. However, most of this was for conventions of anywhere from 300 to 2,000 people. What I can't wait for is to find out how Midwest Construction itself was put together, because it's a convention of less than 50 people who come from nine different states, and that's what I plan to do. Fortunately I know the founder personally, so I'll ask next time I see her what advice she might have.
