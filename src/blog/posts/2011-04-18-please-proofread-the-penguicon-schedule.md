I have received surprisingly few proofreading edits to the schedule. I realized that, although I put the schedule out there, I had not asked specifically for proofreading except for one's own itinerary of panels. Many of you may have been waiting for it to settle down. It will never settle down, so now is the best possible time to proofread it! I keep finding problems and fixing them one at a time, but I just have no time to sit down for a start-to-end proofread, and I expect I never will. Please help! [Here it is.](http://penguicon.dabbledb.com/publish/penguicon2011

) Edits are due to me through programbook@penguicon.org and CC the head of programming, Bill Korsak, through programming@penguicon.org by Wednesday night (but the earlier, the better). Thanks so much!

I did a quick, high level pass through and it looks good...tomorrow night I'm going to do a deeper look...the book looks fantastic though! Thank you!

I was referring to the schedule, actually, but corrections to the souvenir book are also highly appreciated!
