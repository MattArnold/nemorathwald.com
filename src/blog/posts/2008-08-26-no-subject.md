If [Bill Kolasa](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0008949b) calls you and asks to come over and says he has something to give you, be aware that it concerns one of those multi-level marketing pyramid schemes he's perpetually involved in. I didn't buy their Mona-Vie Acai Drink. I showed them R's bottle in the fridge which she got from her co-worker, and I said their drink is a bad-tasting drink. I felt it safer not to mention what I think of the health claims. Then I got him and his salesman buddy really excited about registering for Penguicon. I also said I got people to work for Penguicon, and they got other people to work for Penguicon, and they got other people to work for Penguicon. All in a great big pyramid. Scheme. Thing. Except instead of promising Lear jets and yachts, we pay in fun and appreciation.

I started to get excited there - for a moment, I thought you had said something about getting paid in laser jets.

From what I hear that so called juice has a special kind of awful taste to it. And the medical claims are a special kind of awful in there own right. Thanks for the warning.

What's with the stupid acai berries lately? It's like all of a sudden someone invented them in a lab and sold the patent to Amway.

I'm sorry, Matt. If I would have known that was why he wanted your phone number, I would have told him you weren't interested and saved you some trouble. Still, I find it amusing that you not only rejected their sales pitch, but managed to turn the tables and hook them with one of your own. Proof, once again, that you are evil. ;P
