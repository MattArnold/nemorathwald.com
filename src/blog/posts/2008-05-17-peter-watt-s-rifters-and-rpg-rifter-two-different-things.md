The image on the left is cover art for Peter Watts' "Rifters" series about living in _deep sea rifts_. The image on the right is cover art for "The Rifter", a softcover periodical concerning the Megaverse roleplaying game by Palladium Books, in which characters hop between dimensions of spacemen, wizards, cowboys, and super-heroes. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/matt.mattarn/SE3lwhbpzxI/AAAAAAAACvQ/pHjtayZJD4Y/s288/maelstrom.jpg) ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/matt.mattarn/SC8aPxUX2gI/AAAAAAAACtM/CW7aKH0nVPg/s144/notequal.gif) ![](http://www.palladiumbooks.com/Merchant2/catalog/images/142.jpg) Oh no. Oh good grief no. I've missed out on Peter Watts' tales of suicidal nihilistic antisocial deep-sea posthumans all this time, because I thought from the name that they were Young Adult franchise novels! I nodded sagely and was stoic about how we all have to pay the bills and there's no shame in it. If only I had given it a closer look, I might have realized that an author who tends to write about the Holocaust, pedophiles, and imaginative new forms of disembowelment had _not_ attempted to produce light reading for the beach. Fortunately he's released [the entire Rifters series for free](http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts.htm)!
