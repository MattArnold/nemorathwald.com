This makes me feel extremely happy! After the way I had shot myself in the foot, I worried the Free Software Foundation would simply ignore me. You can see how favorable the language is. Now I will compose a brief response to this as professionally as I can muster, to keep the door open for all kinds of interactions in the future.

Hello Matt, Thanks for your application for the Campaigns Manager position. Unfortunately it did arrive too late, as we had made an offer to another candidate. Your skills and background experience are a good fit for this position, and I will hold on to your contact details for future reference. Thanks again, and I hope we get a chance to work together on related matters within the community. -peter
