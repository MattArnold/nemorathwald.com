Dear friends list, you're all invited to my 31st birthday party at Bill Putt's house! The pool heater is broken, so despite this being a Blasted Bill party we don't expect any nudity-- the traditional skinny-dipping is unlikely. However, if you want to be there past about 11 PM, I warn you that you should be the kind of person who isn't bothered by a few folks getting naked for no reason. Because at Bill's parties you never know. E-mail me for directions at matt.mattarn@gmail.com.

I'm surprised I forgot to mention that. It's tonight!

Whoa! Holy short-notice, batman :) I'd go.. but my vision being as bad as it is, I don't think driving after dark would be a good idea. (Too bad, because a party sounds good) Hope you have a great time, though :)

31? D0000000d. I seriously thought you were only a year older than I am.

Sorry. Strawberry Festival insanity tonight. I'll see you next week!

Completely OT: Can you put me in contact with Bill (not Putt), the guy that was checking out room parties for penguicon?

The other Bill's AIM screen name is WilliamJAlbin Other contact info, I have no idea, unfortunately. Hopefully Matt can add more.

Pooh, tonight? Alas, I am utterly exhausted from going to Notre Dame for a work thing. Will you be at the picnic tomorrow? May I give you a belated birthday hug?

I will be there, and yes you may!

I would have liked to go.... if the party wasn't... now! Hope you have a great time! :)
