[District 9](http://www.d-9.com/) will shake you to your core. In fact, it may lead to a core _breach_, causing you to undergo emergency core ejection through your tear ducts. Possibly your throat if you have a weak stomach. I warn you-- some scenes will be hard to watch, if movies are sometimes hard for you to watch. D9 is a pedal-to-the-medal combat thriller with lethal gadgets that are imaginative and large. However, it is also a smart science-fiction film. D9 highlights the entire spectrum of prejudice. The obvious part is the inhumanity of the powerful, in the slum, corporate lab, gangster den, battlefield, and concentration camp. More importantly, that inhumanity is propped up by the banal indifference of a heartless public. In D9, some characters are genial and likable in one breath, and in the next, consider ingroup loyalty to be conscientious and normal. Group identity will not protect them-- that is an illusion. They may be at the back of the line for the meat grinder, but as long as they allow the meat grinder to remain, everyone is standing in line.

So you liked it huh? I'm somewhere in the middle. Although I've had several people rave about it. I will agree it is imaginative, intelligent and original, and we've have far to little of that in science fiction of late. I can't help but make some comparisons of the nazi/jewish history. And I wonder how much of that I'm basing that on the stars facial hair and cut in the film and the placement in Johannesburg.

I went to see it again, and I still love it. This time I didn't have managers waiting outside the theatre making sure that the crowd didn't want refunds. ;P
