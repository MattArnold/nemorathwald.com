Awesome, and I really like the placards.. although leave it to geeks to reinforce stereotype by taking like a THOUSAND HITS to break a pinata! :P

Yeah, didn't have time for paper mache so he made it out of cardboard.

Hehe, that is even more awesome, a trick pinata! I want to make one out of aluminum covered in cushioning...
