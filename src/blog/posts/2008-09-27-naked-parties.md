![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000cpxkt/s320x320) used to throw pool parties where we all would get naked. I had no problem with this at that time, so it should not be so surprising when I'm completely on board with spontaneous nudity at a different party. There was someone who was at both types of parties, and remembers. She was the only one not surprised to look over in the corner and see me already down to my skivvies with no prompting. The others were "OMG, not Matt! Never Matt! He's too straight-laced!" Au contraire, mon cherie. If I had a problem with group nudity, I would have kinks very different from the ones I actually have. The true source of reluctance is the awareness that it is easier to _escalate_ than to _de-escalate_! Reluctance is sometimes just savoring the process of escalation. You want to postpone the point where you say "Well, now we're all naked, what do we do now?" if the only way to go is back the way you came. Nudity, as with so many worthy activities, does not involve quite the same kind of socializing. What with the distraction and all, going back to a normal conversation with beautiful naked people would be like trying to resume a conversation while skiing. A pool party is cool because the answer to "what now" is "now we swim". I'm probably sure most people are OK with that in our crowd. Sadly, this last event was not a pool party, and as there was nowhere acceptable left to escalate, I put my clothes back on. Others decided to play Rock Band while naked. Good choice. It was a blast. I now am considering how to engineer a situation that is not so short-lived.

You could ask the owner of the pool to have a party before they close it up for the winter...

These people who think your laces are straight, where do they know you from?

They were all people from conventions.

Ah, but just BEING naked is it's own reward.

I mean, how could it be otherwise? Barring ice-cold temperatures or someone who looks like John McCain being in the room, I mean. ;-)

Ahh, excellent points! Escalation/de-escalation. (Also great point that pool party has a natural endgame). Whenever nakedness sprang up at the parties I've been to, it usually turns into pretty intense sincere 4am-type conversation (about life, beliefs, etc). Which.. is totally addictive, but not great with all crowds. Now, naked Rock Band, on the other hand..! Brilliant.
