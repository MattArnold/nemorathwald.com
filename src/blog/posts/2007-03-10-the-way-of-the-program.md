I just finished reading [chapter one](http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/chap01.html) of the "Learning With Python" version of ["How To Think Like A Computer Scientist"](http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/index.html). That chapter alone, "The Way of the Program", comprised of a single webpage, is a thing of beauty. I am not just more knowledgeable for having read it; I feel like I am actually smarter. I encourage you to read it. I am considering adapting section 1.8, Formal and Natural Languages, as part of a slide presentation about [Lojban](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Learning_Lojban.htm) geared toward totally non-technical audiences at the next [ConFusion](http://www.stilyagi.org/cons/2008/).

Brilliant book/tutorial. It's probably the single best resource for coming up to speed on Python in a short amount of time. All the necessary info, none of the fluff. I started on the [C++](http://ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCS/cpp.php) version over the weekend because somehow I came across the notion that it would be a good idea to take another stab at C++.
