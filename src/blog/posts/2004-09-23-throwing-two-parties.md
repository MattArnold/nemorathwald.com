I'm throwing two parties at my house this weekend. [SEMI-abstract gamers](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/semi-abstract-gamers/) is having an all-day prototype playtest on Saturday, and the first M.O.F.O. party is on Sunday. Does anybody local have some folding chairs and tables you could let me borrow?

Give me a hand clearing the basement tonight, and there's my drafting table, plus the church-basement-sized folding table that are available. One or the other should be sufficiently sized. Plus, there are some folding, and not so folding chairs down in the basement that you probably haven't noticed yet. ;-)
