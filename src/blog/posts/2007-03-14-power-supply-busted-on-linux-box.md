The power supply busted on my Linux box. Just for the record. I might want to get this Mac set up, but moving the keyboards and mice is a hassle. For now, just Windows.

I have a few spares. You can have one, if you'd like. Any idea as to the wattage of the old one?

It was currently running on 400 watts. I know we tried a 250 watt while building it, and it wasn't enough. Can I come and pick one up?
