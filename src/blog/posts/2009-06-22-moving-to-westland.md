We are probably moving in with Trav in Westland, slowly over the course of July. The downsides are reduced space, and slight increase in distance to the post office, bus stops, and the school that I can't afford to continue anyway. So that's not bad. Well, it's farther from Ann Arbor Gaming Group, but I can still go to that from time to time. Life improvements include:

1.  Vastly reduced expense.
2.  Half an hour closer to every person who I see with any regularity (except Bill, and that is not a change in distance). Fifteen minutes from Castle Bradaki, a social hub of fandom exceeding even that of Tio's.
3.  Regularly scheduled game nights have occurred at this apartment weekly for years.
4.  A dishwasher.
5.  An actual television. We have been using a computer as a DVD player.
6.  Our current apartment complex has speed bumps of doom which probably contravene regulations.
7.  A large cement patch out back for spray-gluing things to other things.
8.  A ferret!

I have never owned a ferret, but I adore them! Unfortunately I just gave away my book on ferret care through [Bookmooch](http://bookmooch.com/). Yes, I own books on pets that I don't own. The ferret is fat and lethargic, and I intend to provide him with a more active lifestyle. And before you ask, yes, he is de-musked. I have no significant sense of smell in any case.

I hope that means this we will see more of you. :)

Of course! Provided nothing goes wrong. If my car breaks down again, the fifteen minutes would turn into two hours by bus.

You will also live upstairs from the BadKitty, and are, of course, free to visit any time - but remember, we have feline critters. We have a pool in the complex, the back yard is Hines Park, and we aren't far from things like the grocery store, post office, etc. Zeke is entertaining, gaming has been going on in Trav's home for 20 years, and we're right down the road from a convention hotel :)

OK! Can you help us out and go talk to Trav? We've been trying to get in touch with him since Monday about moving in, but have received no response to our emails and phone calls. We need to resolve things by the end of the week. Can you do me a favor and ask him to reply?

I spoke to him this a.m. before going to work. On Tuesday nights, he is in "dad" mode and has his daughter from the time he gets off work until he drops her off at 7:30 and when he gets home he has his dementia radio show. He hasn't had a chance to sit down and answer your emails - but he DID get them. He's going to sit down and answer your questions tonight after he gets finished with errands. Do you have his cell phone number? If not, email me at daydreamr68@yahoo.com or send me a message through livejournal (my screen name is Flutterby68) and I'll give it to you. Also, if you have any questions feel free to ask me as well. I've lived here since early 2005 myself and you've been to my place before (birthday party that same year!)

We have his phone number, but he wasn't answering because he was in Dad mode.

Sounds like a good deal! The downside is that you'll be closer to me. Mwahahahaha :p
