When we had Chris DiBona from Google as [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/)'s Guest of Honor, I hoped to have a panel about Google in science fiction. For instance, there is a piece of [Flash animation science fiction about Google's next ten years](http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/epic). ["Turing's Cathedral" is a non-fiction essay by George Dyson about his visit to the Googleplex](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dyson05/dyson05_index.html), and it gets very science fictional at the end. One of the pieces I remembered but could no longer find was this one-page super-short story: [The Nine Billion Names of God](http://www.365tomorrows.com/09/12/the-nine-billion-names-of-god/) by Kathy Kachelries. It shares the same name as [a classic tale by Arthur C. Clarke.](http://lucis.net/stuff/clarke/9billion_clarke.html)
