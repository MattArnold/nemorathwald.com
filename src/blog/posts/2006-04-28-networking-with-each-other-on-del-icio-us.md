The social bookmarking service del.icio.us became even more social by introducing a feature that I've wanted for a long time. They call it networking, but what it amounts to is just like a Livejournal Friends List, except it's for your latest bookmarked web links instead of blog entries. The "social" aspect of del.icio.us used to be that you could give other people a link to your bookmarks, like this: [http://del.icio.us./Matt\_Arnold](http://del.icio.us./Matt_Arnold) But now you don't have to visit all your friends' pages because they can all be [listed like an LJ friends page](http://del.icio.us/network/Matt_Arnold). I've networked with and , but if you have a del.icio.us account too, let me know and I'll subscribe!

I didn't really understand del.icio.us till you said something, I didn't even know it was a website - I just filed it into the "think about it later" pile and never really thought about it much. But thanks. Now I know what to do with it. I've added you in my network.

Unfortunately, networks are not reciprocal, so having added me to your network didn't add you to mine. I'd need your user name for that.

For somebody who didn't know what it was, you sure did take to it quickly!

What can I say - I love links! It's like the biggest relief ever - my bookmark list is huge, so I pretty much transferred everything over to there. Oh, and that Blue Mars site is awesome - I listen all the time when I want something without lyrics.

My delicious (I refuse to remember where those stupid periods go) account: http://del.icio.us/burstlag I mainly use it as a substitute for in-browser bookmarks since I'm on any number of different computers in the course of a day. I don't quite get what's "social" about it yet, aside from the recent development.

Thanks! Who are you? _I don't quite get what's "social" about it yet, aside from the recent development._ Other people can see your bookmarks. Plus del.icio.us tracks a list of the most popular things being bookmarked at http://del.icio.us/popular -- which is my favorite place to see all the coolest things on the web.

Some call me Charles Ulrich. I don't do the livejournal thing much anymore, but I found your blog through a link you posted to the Penguicon mailing list. (And Brendan's through yours.) Now that Penguicon's over, I've actually had time to do some recreational web browsing. :)

Interesting. I'm on SEVERAL computers, during any given day, and my bookmarks are scattered. There is a base set of bookmarks that may or may not map into delicous well considering my heavy usage of the Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox (I rarely place bookmarks anywhere else and keep on making folders and sub-folders within my toolbar.) But the problem is my lack of syncronisation of bookmarks. My base set follows me around where ever I go (it's an HTML file for pete's sake) but my other bookmarks vary widely depending on place and circumstance. I have nothing embarrasing in bookmarks, so it may be cool to share, but I don't know which set to share and how hard it may be to add bookmarks to the site.

It sounds like you need this Firefox-to-de.icio.us bookmarks uploader: http://www.julian-bez.de/delicious/ The Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox works really well in synchronization with del.icio.us, to view an RSS feed of your bookmarks or tags or other peoples' bookmarks or tags. Plus there is [a del.icio.us plugin](http://delicious.mozdev.org/) for Firefox that puts "view my del.icio.us" and "del.icio.us bookmark and tag this page" buttons next to your home button.
