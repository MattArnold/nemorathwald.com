While looking for a space in the parking garage, my car overheated, as it tends to do. My co-workers and my boss saw me pushing it with a long line of cars behind me, and helped me fit it into a nearby spot. I'm so tired of this. If I weren't so over-scheduled, and if I had another way to get to work on Monday morning, I'd take the car in on a Saturday morning to have this fixed. The fan behind the grill, which I have repaired before, doesn't work. It doesn't blow through the radiator when I'm sitting in traffic. So the only ways to prevent overheating are to drive at least thirty miles per hour, or turn the heater on full blast. The vents the A/C blows out of is set by a knob which has somehow fused in place, so it only blows directly in my face.

When pulling out of the sardine-can from the above story, I scraped against a two-foot wide yellow metal pole. I just tried to open my passenger door today. I discovered it has yellow streaks on it and it won't open. Thanks for letting me vent.
