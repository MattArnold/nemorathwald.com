The catalog project ended and today my temp job came to a close. Currently I'm only working for Escape Artists, but I'm open to additional work.

What is "escape artists"? ( I assume you're not practicing with handcuffs and chains underwater.)

Have any interest in preparing taxes? It's more a long-term solution, but it'd be something semi-regular.

I have no work to offer, but I do have a paper box full of classic Sci-fi; Asimov, Clark, Bradbury. Either you will say "Why yes Toni, I would love to have these books, as I may read them myself or give them out to others. Please drop them off to me," or you will say "No thanks"; in which case they will be sitting on the curb come next Sunday evening.

No thanks. Paper books are heavy and take up space, so I try to limit how many I keep. Thanks anyway!
