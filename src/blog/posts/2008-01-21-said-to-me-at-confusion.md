"You should wear a badge ribbon reading 'DRIVEN TO AN UNHOLY DEGREE', because you are" - Jeremy from Grand Rapids

* * *

"I was in a conversation yesterday in which we were mentioning how you look like Daniel Jackson" "SWEET I'm being compared to a xenolinguist. Movie Stargate or TV Stargate?" "The TV one, Michael Shanks" "I can talk as fast as him if I get enough caffeine"

* * *

"I'd like to give you this as our thanks for making a great program book under adverse conditions" -- at the Feedback Session, giving me a gift certificate which is actually as good of a wage as I usually charge personal friends for freelance work! WOW

Before ConFusion I had started to take on so much volunteer work that I began to lose sight of what was so great about conventions. This weekend re-energized my view of it.

You've more than earned it. We approved that as a unanimous decision by the Board. You do great work, and you're willing to step up when nobody else can. You've got a lot to be proud of.

It was good to see you too. I heard you were going away. We'll miss you around here. But good luck with your adventures.

it's true that i'm going away. and thanks! will be back through here on a semiregular basis, i suspect. seminars at least once a year, and maybe some option on personal travel as well. will have to see how it goes, but at the moment, it's hard for me to picture not being back around.

Good to hear that the anticipated train wreck wasn't.
