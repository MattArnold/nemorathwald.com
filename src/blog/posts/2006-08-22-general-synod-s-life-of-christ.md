A British television show called "Not the Nine O'Clock News" parodies the controversy that took place in England when Monty Python created "The Life Of Brian". In this parody, comedian Rowan Atkinson (better known as Mr. Bean) plays a catholic filmmaker who has created a film about some unknown guy "Jesus Christ" who they angrily claim is an offensive parody of their lord and savior John Cleese. http://www.youtube.com/v/ykN-00i7VVs

Fantastic. Makes me want to go back and revisit all of my favorite sketches from the comic messiahs. :)
