On the way here, the gas, speed and heat gauges dropped to the bottom and stopped working. Then the needles crawled back up. My car stalled as I entered the parking garage this morning. I had to push it into the parking space. It wouldn't start again. I'm considering getting a bicycle and taking the Telegraph bus. Anybody want to sell me a bicycle? In the meantime, I've got to figure out how to get home.
