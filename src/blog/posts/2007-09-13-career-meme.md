_Instructions_ (1) Go to www.careercruising.com (2) Put in Username: nycareers - Password: landmark (3) Take 'Matchmaker' quiz at the upper left corner (4) Post the top 10 results. This quiz did a pretty good job, but the first one threw me for a loop. 1. Sport Psychology Consultant -- HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Are games sports? Then they might be on to something. You can't make a socially-sound community in an MMORPG without understanding the motivations of players. Yes, that would be a good career. 2. ESL Teacher -- OK, I know I like to get up on my soapbox, but am I a snake oil salesman? Oh wait... This doesn't mean [EST](http://skepdic.com/est.html). It means English as a Second Language. OK, good. 3. Foreign Language Instructor 4. Actor 5. Special Effects Technician 6. Psychologist 7. Computer Trainer 8. Model Maker 9. Air Traffic Controller -- ???? 10. Director of Photography
