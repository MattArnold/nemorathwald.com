At least once a week, somebody at college makes a remark about my catalog case. "Here comes suitcase guy." "Is that yours? Really?" "What have you got in there?" Mainly I have a laptop, a jumbo-size touch-sensitive drawing tablet, a mouse, headphones, class paperwork, the two textbooks for today's classes, and dinner. I don't want this stuff banging around in a backpack. Oh, and often I also have a card box with several pounds of Dominion cards. (You never know.) I get asked for directions to the music building because they assume I'm carrying an instrument. I don't know if "Have you thought about carrying something smaller?" is an attempt to help me in some way that I couldn't help myself, or if they would be better off in some way that I don't know about.

The simpler way to handle it might be to tell people where the music school is.

A) They're jealous. B) At least you're not invisible. :-)
