_Disclaimer: This post is not intended as a statement either for or against the practice of Tarot reading._ While working on the vector art for the giant floor-covering hex mats of Settlers of Catan for Penguicon, I came across this old work of mine from years ago. In 2001, I wanted to play the game of [Gnostica](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/games/Gnostica/GnosticaRules.html) invented by Looney Labs, which involves a Tarot deck. The only people I knew with whom to play games, in my pre-SF-Convention days, were my siblings, but I knew I had to conceal the occult connection from my parents or they wouldn't let my siblings play it. In fact, they were likely to not allow such a deck in their home. So I invented [this deck](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/gallery/0000663p), and before long, it occured to me to make the royalty cards be _Princess Bride_ characters; from there the major and minor arcana took their disguise from the movie as well. I'm sure I still have a hard copy glued to index cards somewhere. I abandoned the deck when I made my [Gnostica learner's deck,](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Games.htm#gnostica) but I can't believe I forgot about this deck after all the work I put into it! I've posted most of it to [my LJ pictures gallery](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/gallery/0000663p).

Pretty cool. I've been trying to come up with a Harry Potter tarot deck for a while, but it's been on the back burner.

See, now there's a tarot deck worth owning. :) You should get some printed up.

Thank you! Now I really should find a way to get these decently printed up...
