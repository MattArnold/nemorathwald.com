No I had not, but I'm glad you asked. **Ready Stamps** of San Diego California is what you might call a community-based business as part of the Cerebral Palsy Association. recommended them to me. She's very satisfied with their products, and so am I. It'll cost $32 for the setup and first stamp, plus about $8 for additional copies of the stamp. Check out [their website](http://www.readystamps.com/) for more info. You can get helpful guidelines [here](http://www.polyclay.com/ready.htm). Let me know if you have a project you want to talk about.

If you don't mind, Matt, I have a few tutorials on my blog using the Ready Stamps too, on porcelain and terra cotta. I thought this might be a good place to share them: http://earthenwood-beads.blogspot.com/2007/12/queen-ornament-tutorial.html http://earthenwood-beads.blogspot.com/2007/12/candy-ornament-tutorial.html
