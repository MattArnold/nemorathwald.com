This is the third time in five days that I've drained my car battery by leaving the headlights on.

RELAYS ARE WONDERFUL. A bit of hacking should allow you to gate the power to the headlights by the ignition switch.

I've often wondered about that. Why bother having a headlight switch at all. It's safer to just keep the lights turned on. The first cars built didn't. At what point did drivers first think, "ya know, it would be nice if I could turn my lights off, because I don't want to be seen on the road."

I've got running daytime lights as is, but if you turn yours on, doesn't your car beep at you if you don't turn them off after the ignition is turned off(when you open the door)?

No, it doesn't! My mind has been unfortunately trained by using cars that do. This is a 1994 Ford Escort.

I put a piece of tape right past my steering wheel that said "turn your lights off!" in my old car.
