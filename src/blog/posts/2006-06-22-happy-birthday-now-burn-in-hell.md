Why do I keep reading [PCCBoard](http://www.)\*? I'm the board's resident infidel. I don't post all that much anymore, but when someone started a thread ([click here](http://www.pccboard.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&postid=387828)) to wish me a happy birthday, and dozens of members chimed in, I felt like it would almost be rude not to participate. Eventually, the results became predictably uncivil. Several people baited me, and I finally responded to one of them in a manner which I felt was non-inflammatory. This one was a suggestion that I should thank God for the good circumstances 2006 has brought me. It was thought-provoking to realize how many of the things I now enjoy are in direct contradiction to their teachings; even if their deity really existed, it would seem odd to thank him for things he prohibits. In fact, scripture states that [divine punishment is reserved only to improve the character of the devout](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=65&chapter=12&version=31), serving as evidence that I will not be in heaven. If I were to accept that teaching, that's an incongruous thing to thank God for. The thread immediately descended into claims that I am incapable of logic, I receive my life's guidance from video games, I need to repent before I'm destroyed, and I should tell Spock hello. Fortunately there are many on PCCBoard who sincerely wish me well and even like me; but given that so many fundamentalist churches teach that a funeral is a good time and place to point out that the deceased is in hell, it seems inevitable for the virtual birthday party to be crashed. When people sincerely believe that your eternal destiny is at stake, it's reasonable, necessary, or even unavoidable to prioritize addressing that problem above all other concerns, given their views. I thought I was participating in a classy and pleasant discussion, but they don't perceive any such discussion in those terms. This is because they consider spiritual talk a "serious" topic, and I consider it no more of a downer than debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. The social customs are completely different than those in the reality-based community. \* PCCBoard.com is the unofficial messageboard of my wacky fundamentalist alma mater, Pensacola Christian College, which I have posted about many times.

Not to worry Matt. I'll save you good place. We've both got friends in both places.

Matt, You characterization of "our diety" and "our teachings" has much to be desired. But, for what it's worth, I think you should keep posting at PCCBoard. terjbe.ui

_given that so many fundamentalist churches teach that a funeral is a good time and place to point out that the deceased is in hell_... If this happened at a funeral for someone I was fond of, I would be sorely tempted to speed said person(s) to their just reward. Obnoxious bastards...

That's probably why I heard it talked about and preached about so much more often than I've heard of it actually being done. And on the rare occasions when it is done, it's usually outside the funeral home, with posterboard signs.

Again, Matt, I know it helps your cause to make broad generalizations about "those fundamentalist churches," but by equating people like Fred Phelps with fundamentalism you're building a straw man.

I just read the thread, and it really does seem to be a conflict of world-views. From his point of view, Bob's "Make sure you thank God for His blessings" may just have been a jocular reminder -- something he might have said to anyone who seemed to be straying a bit. Perhaps it was akin to: "Make sure you look both ways before crossing the street!" - a bit condescending perhaps, but well-meaning. However, the street-crossing comment would probably annoy someone who didn't believe in the danger posed by automobiles to pedestrians; likewise, perhaps you were needled by Bob's 'reminder', and so took it as an opportunity to reaffirm your atheism (or an aspect of it) and your reasons for it. Bob (and others) in turn took your reply to be offensive, as it struck near, if not at, their core beliefs. (They might not have liked your use of the pronoun "it" for their god entity, either.) I sympathize with your frustration at talking to fundamentalists on topics that seem innocent. \[By the way: Happy belated birthday! I had no idea you were born in June.\]

No, I did not take offense to Matt's comments. I only clarified his misunderstanding of Scripture. If you believe (as Matt seems to) that Christianity is defined by what you watch on TV and by what Fred Phelps does, you will come away with a very distorted view. Quite frankly, I do hope Matt had a great birthday. However, I also wanted to remind him to thank the Lord who has blessed Matt with life, breath, and all things he has.

Happy Birthday, Matt. Sad to say that many people feel that reflecting on your good fortune and expressing joy and fellowship with friends and family is not enough, you have to tack on a hollow affirmation of an intervening supernatural presence. The PCC board discussion seems pretty civil and intelligent, so far anyway. That's probably why you keep going back.

Hi Matt, Former PCCer, current atheist here. I have successfully avoided the temptation to go to PCC board for several months now; it can be such a downer. I find it almost unhealthy to go there, since I often end up stewing all the next day over some of the things said there. (I never post though.) And since none of my friends from when I was there post, it's not even useful that way. How useful do you think PCC board is in understanding what is going on in fundamentalism? (If such a thing can even be described under one word.) Not everything you have done there is useless though. There are plenty of lurkers there, I am sure, and not all of them are close minded. Your post on the Student Voice board "Alternate Detox Suggestion" hit me at the right time on my path from faith to reason. I had been studying creationism, and was having trouble digesting the fact that I had been lied to so egregiously. That was kind of an 'ah-ha!' moment for me.
