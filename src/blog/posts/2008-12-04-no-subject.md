The Beatles said "Happiness is a warm gun." No. Happiness is a horse in "Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" with a name that is 256 characters long, so that as soon as a character tries to speak the name that you gave your horse, it results in a stack crunch (buffer overflow), to exploit a vulnerability that uses those 256 characters to install [the Homebrew Channel](http://hbc.hackmii.com/) on the Nintendo Wii game system. "Homebrew" means games and programs that are written by consumers. Jen's new Wii can now launch, for instance, Linux. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/STdTdpQbCvI/AAAAAAAAF9k/iTImrvFw4WM/s288/opensec-tux-mario.png)

Funny that they don't broadcast on Sunday, but Saturday, the day of the Sabbath for millions if not billions of people in this world, is perfectly fine.

Yay for the hacking of Jen's Wii! You should give it a new name to celebrate.
