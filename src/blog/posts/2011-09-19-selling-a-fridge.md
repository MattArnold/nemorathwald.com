I'm selling [a fridge on Craigslist](https://post.craigslist.org/k/8Ahblfvi4BGs0BcQXPbPuQ/mFBJ3?s=preview). Let me know if you want to buy it.

Do you have the box? The potential for fridge-box castle should not be overlooked.

Very likely. Our fridge has been a problem for a long time, and we've been talking about getting a new one. How big is it? And do you have any leads on a way to move it, or should we plan on a U-Haul van rental as part of the price?
