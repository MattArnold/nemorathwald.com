Things I have done that those on my LJ friends list probably haven't. #1. Recited the sinner's prayer out loud on my knees in a thick British movie villian accent while wearing a Captain Hook costume in front of two hundred people. #2. Been in a relationship with a woman who I had previously been married to. #3. Learned to speak [an artificial language](http://www.lojban.org/) with a grammar based on formal predicate-argument logic systems. #4. Playtested Disney's prototype virtual reality magic carpet ride system during the mid-nineties. #5. When I was a teen, I neglected to learn the name of a person who had been my only friend for almost a year. It turned out to be the same as mine. #6. Got to the age of 29 without ever consuming alcoholic beverages, and currently have still never used tobacco or narcotics. I know at least two others on my LJ friends list of whom this is true, but I'm putting it in there anyway. That's all I can think of right now. People usually list ten, but this meme can't tell me what to do. I will partake on my own terms. It's entirely possible that other people have done one or more of these.

Re #6: Sigh. Didn't even make it to 15 on any of those.... On the other hand -- Last week was my 20th anniversay of quitting smoking (cue John Lennon singing "Cold Turkey"). Re #2: Haven't dated my ex-wife post divorce (17 years was sufficient, thank-you!) but there's been more than a couple women I've done the serious relationship twice. Evidently once wasn't enough to convince me of my folly. :-)

I only made it to 19 without consuming alcoholic beverages, but I felt like quite a freak for even that level of inexperience. Though not as bad as my mother, who asked me, when I was 25 or so, if I'd tried alcohol, and if so, what did it taste like? I'm with you on the tobacco thing. Dunno what you consider a narcotic, but I may well be with you on that as well.

#6 - Hah! Got all of you beat. Age 46, and nary a dram or toodle of the demon substances (except as required for Nyquil and such (ugh)).
