The system of naming computers after who gave them to me is breaking down, as I now have too many Jens and Steves. Steve2 arrived by UPS yesterday, and floated in the door as if on magnetic waves, attracted relentlessly to its soulmate. When Steve2 entered the computer room, the CD duplicator rose from the pedestal whence I had been making sacrifices and obeisances to it for weeks. The two machines coiled and twined together in levetating midair dance. "I would never operate with any computer other than you, my darling!" the duplicator cried. Rachel, Randy, Jen1 and Jen2 averted their blinking LED eyes and looked pissed. The other peripherals cooed and soothed them on the adequacy and satisfaction of their USB ports. (Except for Randy, who suffers USB dysfunction, but the peripherals are diplomatic about this.) "Do you two need anything?" The lovers ignored me. Brushing away my fidget and blush, I said brusquely, "Look, I'm going to the Apple Store to pick up Steve1 from service. I'll be back before the post office closes. You had better have something for me to ship." And they made optical disk babies all day.

Matt, that was the most beautiful description I think I've ever read of two pieces of technology coupling. I almost had tears in my eyes...well, tears of laughter anyhow. I still don't get how we managed to get your CD duplicator working with Jen2(?), and then it decided to completely freak out like a woman who has just realized she fell for another partner when she had promised herself she would be monogamous. ;P
