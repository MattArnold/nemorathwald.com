I once bought a tiny USB flash drive, about the size of an SD card, to embed in a necklace pendant. I tried to cast the pendant in bronze, but my wax carving was too detailed and it came out as a wad of bronze slag. I don't know much about jewelry design. What should the pendant look like? It needs to have the plug of the drive sticking out of the bottom.

I don't know much about jewelry design either, but it sounds like a neat project. Perhaps you could get some inspiration from looking at other custom USBs - found some fun ones doing a google image search on "custom USB drives."
