![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0007s8y4) **Announcement:** My LJ friends list is invited to celebrate my Billionth Birthsecond on the evening of Thursday, February 23. The actual billionth second since my birth will have already passed at about four o'clock that morning, so of course we won't be exact. Here's hoping for billlllions and billllllllions more! It will be at (\*Edited to remove my former address. Thanks to everyone who attended!\*). Show up around 7:00 PM, or wander in as late as 10:00 PM, and stay until about one in the morning if you feel so inclined. The party will last at least a billion picoseconds. I will provide snacks and drinks. If you bring some food or drinks that would be nice, but don't feel like you have to.

Well now. I'll check on a few things for that night, but I might be able to make it!

If you're interested, here's a javascript that calculates your billionth birthsecond (0r any other time interval in seconds). It takes time zone, daylight savings, and leap years into account, and lets you watch your personal seconds odometer tick by in real time. Check it out at: http://www.bmi.net/~dogpatchnorth/seccalc.php (Sorry I didn't have this in time for your odometer event.)
