I'm blogging this from Con-Versation, Michigan's annual relaxicon, where we have just finished several hands of [The Great Dalmuti](http://boardgamegeek.com/game/929), inspiring me to take this photo. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/matt.mattarn/SIv2jR9452I/AAAAAAAADbc/6Qx-8TCPrSA/s400/EPICDALMUTI.JPG) Bahb Son Of Bob is such a good sport.

I love that card game. I can never get anyone to play it though.
