The Penguicon wrap-up meeting was great. Becoming con chair is called "taking a bullet," so when it was announced that Bill Putt accepted the job of con chair for Penguicon 2005, he leaped to his feet to slap a bullseye on his chest. Steve handed the meeting over to him and Bill is already rising to the challenge of leadership with great aplomb. Friday I helped Bill clean and organize his storage closet, and he gave me an Apple Mac G4! (At the meeting yesterday I showed them my Apple dogtags and he said I'm a scary man.) He assures me that it worked when he tried it, but so far I can't get the monitor to show anything. Also, my new Linux box doesn't access dialup, and doesn't access the CD drive, so I can't manage to use it for anything. My main computer, an AthlonXP 1700, is constantly crashing from its viruses and spyware that my best efforts haven't cured. I'm backing up all my files so I can format the hard drive and re-install Windows XP. But I have at least one working computer! THANK THE GREAT GREEN ARKLESEIZURE FOR PALM OS! I'm taking Rachel to dinner and a movie for her birthday tonight.

I wish I could've made it to the meeting, but I've resigned myself to the increased separation. That aside, if you need yet another pair of eyes on your linux box, I'd be glad to help.

I appreciate that. Considering how far away you live, I don't know how you're going to get the pair of eyes on the Linux box, unless you had somebody else's eyes in mind.
