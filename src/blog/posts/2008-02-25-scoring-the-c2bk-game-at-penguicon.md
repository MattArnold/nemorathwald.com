![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000b7b1s) I made this animation to illustrate how a puppetmaster keeps track of scoring in Cruel 2 B Kind on a sheet of paper. The phone calls come in to report each killing (with kindness). When a team gets killed (with kindness), they get a reward for having survived as long as they did. So it's ten points higher than the last team that got killed (with kindness). And the reward for killing (with kindness) goes down by ten points every time it happens. This is just the scoring before the award ceremony, so there is a part which is not listed in this animation: the "Booty". Individual victims choose an individual member of the team that killed them(WK), to whom to give their item of "booty", based on which team member did the most impressive kindness that killed them(WK). They then join the team that killed them(WK) and wander the convention as a human amoeba! Finally the two remaining crowds clash in an apocalypse of sweetness and light! At the closing, everybody presents the "booty" items, which add 100 points to the winning overall amoeba. Plus, the scoring sum you see on this animation, on your original team's line, plus the numberX100 of booty items you are personally carrying, adds up to show the supreme individual player champion! By the way, can you believe that zero teams have formed for this game at Penguicon so far? And yet I constantly hear eagerness to play. Such procrastination! If you were waiting to come up with a cool team name, feel free to use these examples, but you'll have to hurry to be the first to lay claim! Again, it is important that you not tell anyone you are a player, except for your team. Email penguicon.c2bk@gmail.com with the names of your team members, your team name, email address, and your phone number or text message number.

_Aperature Science - Still Alive_ If nothing else, THAT will have me laughing for a good amount of time.

Wow-people aren't flocking to play a game that causes the mind to go numb just by reading the game's premise? What's wrong with these people? = )
