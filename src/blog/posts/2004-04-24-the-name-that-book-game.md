Some other LiveJournals have started playing this neat little game. 1. I went to the nearest bookshelf. In this case it was on my PDA. You can't get nearer than a pocket! 2. I opened the 3rd book from the left on the 2nd shelf. There was only one list so I'm fudging and just picking the third book. 3. I went to page 87. 4. I typed the first full paragraph on the page, in this case the screen: "I don't think -- " 5. The next step is to choose my favorite word. I don't know why this step is here. So I am not going to follow it. 6. Now it's up to my LJ friends: what book is this? Frankly, the outcome of this game leaves something to be desired. Now if the _next_ paragraph had been the first full paragraph on the screen, that would have been a great clue, right Art? Art. Art. Art.
