Finally [an online game world that doesn't actually need any players](http://www.progressquest.com/). You create your character and then sit back and let him play the game for you. The Keyboard Shortcut menu is a model of intuitive brevity, copied in its entirety here:

Key

Description

Alt-F4

Exit **Progress Quest**

It's as simple as that. There are no graphics, only progress bars. The game hands your character an endless stream of exotic monsters to murder without any of that tedious worldbuilding or questing in between. In fact, according to the [testimonials](http://www.progressquest.com/testimonials.php) it might consist almost entirely of spyware. Straight to the point, this game. _**"Elegant yet stupidly great"** A superb cross breed of the physical with the spiritual, at once Zen and Canadian Socialist, pure yet full of thick goopy mud._

Is this a joke?

It's too incredibly amusing to not be a joke, and yet, who has the kind of time to set something like that up......for fun?

Oh my God/dess, I'd totally forgotten about ProgressQuest! I used to be way big into it.... hrm, I may have to see if any of my characters still exist. ;)

Just to be picky; the game does also support Ctrl-B (Brag! Post your score & see it on the internet.) Ctrl-G (Guild-join) Ctrl-M (Motto; say something catchy.) I'm up to level 29! Check Mupep [here](http://progressquest.com/oobag.php?name=Mupep). --Bill
