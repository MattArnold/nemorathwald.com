Good gravy, I am swarmed with chat messages from my friends who have simultaneously discovered that Gmail is porting Google Talk directly into their Gmail browser window. I knew about it first, but no matter how often I refresh my browser, the feature hasn't propagated to my account yet. In the middle of a huge Gmail chatfest, I'm still using the desktop client. The nice thing is, though, that they will finally get on Google Talk! I love Google Talk. One of the unfortunate things about other instant message clients is that I don't have the same archived messages on one computer that I do at another. Google Talk is now archived and searchable from within Gmail.

Google does regional rollouts of features, to keep the number of error reports managable. You just happened to be at the end of the list, I think.

Everyone who messaged me lived in the same state as me.

Doesn't mean they were necessarily in the same region, though it's more likely. I have no idea how they decide regions; if it's by IP address, then physical locale won't matter.

_Google Talk is now archived and searchable from within Gmail._ \*tinfoil helmet mode\* Now all of your chats are archived with Big Brother. :)

If it's any consolation, I'm not seeing chat in Gmail either...
