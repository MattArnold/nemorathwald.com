From George P. Dvorsky's Blog, [Sentient Developments](http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2004/12/tsunami-from-hell.html), comes the following sarcastic prayer. _Dear God, as we marvel at Thy creation, this tiny planet Earth on which we dwell, we stand in awe and reverence in the Universe's unfolding. As we continue to stand by You and worship Thee, and as You in turn answer our prayers and watch over us, Your blessed children, we remain in blissful ignorance as to Thine divine plan. But far be it for us to question the motives of God, for You have blessed us with brains too small and weak to comprehend Thine divine logic. Surely there is great wisdom in sweeping 56,000 souls out to sea, 18,000 of them children. For certain Thou has shown great mercy by granting these people a life of poverty and their subsequent reward of death by tsunami. And absolutely must there be kindness in the disease and strife that will inevitably ensue. And in addition to this holy earthquake, we thank You for rectal cancer, male nipples, and for all the hopeful mothers who get to live through a miscarriage. We welcome our ignorance and confusion, and pray that you continue to bless us with Thy merciful bounty and guardianship. Amen._ My own thought on this is that the human race is currently demonstrating with love and charity that we're not as devoid as the bible makes us out to be. We are not alone in the universe, because we have each other. I throw my lot in with the mortals. The claim that we are incapable of love and therefore those who act in such kindness are just being puppeteered by Jesus, is a base accusation for which bible-literalists should be ashamed.

My heart breaks for all those suffering people. There is no evidence of a benevolent daddy deity watching out for humanity. We are all we have, so we better take care of each other.

Hear fucking hear Matt. This, has been one of my base reasons for not listening to the bible-literalists. \*shakes head\* Thanks for this though.

Hi Matt, The Tsunami sucks beyond my ability to comment on it. On the othe hand, why is the guy dissing male nipples? Thanks, Lorrraine

The old saying about "a fish with a bicycle" comes to mind. I don't think he considers male nipples to be harmful in any way, but if we were designed by a perfect creator, one would suppose there would be some purpose or use for every part of the body. Nipples on men is just one of many arbitrary factors, which seem to be indicative that the body's design is not a deliberate artifact of anyone. Some people enjoy male nipples, and they could argue that it would be worthwhile for the creator to foist them on all the rest of us. But it makes sense to hold the supposed product of an omnipotent being to a higher standard. If we expect, as I do, that in the future mere mortals will be able to design their offspring with the ability to switch genders at will, surely an all-powerful being could do at least that well.
