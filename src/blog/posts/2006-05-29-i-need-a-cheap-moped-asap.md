I need a cheap moped ASAP. My car's transmission held out all the way home from Columbus in the "2" position of the gearshift because we didn't let it drop below third gear. As soon as we got off the highway here in town, it refused to shift up into 3rd under any circumstances. We had to turn on the heater full blast to keep the engine from overheating. I called my family, but their vehicles are all in use tomorrow. Reluctantly, I had to admit to myself I will not be capable of picking up from the airport. I left messages but haven't been able to get in touch with her about it since this morning. I, , , , , and went to see XMen 3. I understand 's points about the film, but I still enjoyed it. and had to leave halfway through because was sick and in pain; we found out later he had to go to the emergency room. No word yet about what's wrong. 's crashing on the futon downstairs tonight. just left after we watched a bunch of [GitS: SAC episodes](http://www.ghostintheshell.tv/) and my Penguicon cable TV interview on DVD, which arrived in the mail from the crew of the show. I'll post it to YouTube tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll post again to reflect upon some things from this weekend's convention.

2:30 PM. Due to the car problems I had Friday, she's aware of the issue and talked about getting somebody else to do it. I just haven't been able to confirm thus far whether or not she did.

No worries, I'll pick up Anne. Transmissions suck; after reading many car books, all they advise a home mechanic to do is to "check the fluid level". If it's not low, then the only real option is to replace the transmission. Best of luck with your car. --Bill

I'll do a post in my own LJ later, but it turns out Chuck had appendicitis since Friday, which we thought was gas and constipation. I should have picked it up, but I guess I just thought he was exaggerating about the pain Friday. Anyway, during the movie, it ruptured, he had a sudden burst of absolutely excruciating pain, barely made it to the bathroom, and then he called me from the bathroom to bring the car around back and take him to the hospital, where we found out (after 8 hours of waiting and tests and more waiting, thank goodness for the pain meds they gave him)he has a ruptured appendix. I just got home from the ER, and he's about to go up to surgery. I'm going to take a nap and then go see him. I'll call people with details later.

Call me and let me know which hospital he's in and I'll come visit. Poor Chuck. That's a heck of a lot of pain. That's the sort of pain Karen went through with her pancreatitis and that was not pretty. Chuck must have a high tolerance for pain not to yell and moan. I feel so bad. I had no idea. It makes me wish he had yelled and moaned so I would have known how serious it was.
