![Champion, frmo The Triplets Of Belleville](http://www.filmquarterly.org/images/pict5803_1.jpg)Thanks to everyone who offered to give or loan me a bike, or loan me the money to get one. Last night

[![[info]](http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif)](http://users.livejournal.com/jer_/profile)[**jer\_**](http://users.livejournal.com/jer_/)

gave me one. I took it out today for a couple of hours, and it's great. The back wheel needs alignment, but that poses no problem if I disengage the rear brake. The local bike shop estimates it will cost $10-$20 to fix. Eventually I'll need a security chain, helmet, horn, mirrors and reflective vest. I used to ride in college, and my legs became incredibly toned. I don't mean monstrously disproportionate like in _The Triplets Of Belleville_, but you get the idea. The exercise today was tiring, but felt good.

Thanks! Even though I won't be getting your bike from you now, I still want your contact info by the way. Would you like to take part in constructing or performing in the Lovecraftian marionette show at Penguicon? Email me OK?
