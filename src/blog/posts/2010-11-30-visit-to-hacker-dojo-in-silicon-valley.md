That's where I am right now! This hackerspace is in Mountain View, in Silicon Valley. I'll post my video tour soon. There are a lot of people here, but I didn't film them for privacy and in order to not disturb their work. These are serious people, trying to beat the famous time limit to get "ramen profitable" before the money runs out. But some of them took the time to greet me and get to know me. I got to find out about [YourVersion.org](http://www.yourversion.org). The upshot of this web app (and Android app) is a content aggregator that automatically finds stuff you like. It sounds kind of like StumbleUpon, but better. The co-founders answered all my questions about it and even got a little bit of a peek into its inner workings. My most important question was whether it gets rid of duplicate news items. I'm tired of seeing the exact same article on Slashdot, BoingBoing, Hacker News and Metafilter. They said their dupe detection was pretty good. I've signed up and will see for myself. For starters, I gave it a disambiguation challenge by listing one of my interests as "Dominion". Will it figure out that I mean the card game? Wow. The very first result was [this great Dominion strategy blog](http://dominionstrategy.wordpress.com/)!
