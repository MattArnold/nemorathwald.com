As you know if you read this blog, Penguicon's 2009 Gaming Guest of Honor is Jane McGonigal. The latest game that Jane McGonigal is involved in with The Institute For The Future is [The Free Space Experiment](http://lab.signtific.org/). I've examined [how to play](http://lab.signtific.org/node/9) and [scoring](http://lab.signtific.org/node/5), and I adore it! Here is [my card](http://lab.signtific.org/user/267) in the game. As you can see, I haven't come up with any ideas yet. I didn't know the game had already started! Unfortunately the first experiment ends today. But there will be more.

This looks pretty cool! I think Jane McGonigal has a winner with this idea, at least in my book. :)
