The company I've been temping for agreed to hire me this week. I've been celebrating ever since I found out. It officially starts on the first of December. I just did the calculations this morning and realized I'm not getting a raise. They are "offering" me a pay _cut_ of about a dollar an hour. Second, on salary I can't earn more with overtime. Third, I just now started to get benefits through my temp agency anyway so it's not like that's an improvement. So I wonder why I'm doing this for a job that makes me so depressed. Since it's a temp-to-perm assignment, I believe they would have just let me go if I turned it down.

um.... you're doing it because if you suffer there for 6 months you'll have some sort of job track record that'll look good on a resume and then you'll be able to go look for a job you _do_ like???

I talked to my agent yesterday. She explained that it's not a "pay cut," when you take into account holiday pay, vacation pay, and the benefits package. None of which I care much about since I already had a good-enough HMO through my agency.

I feel bad that this is happening to you. I had hoped that they would have at least paid you more money when they eventually hired you and that would make up for hating the job. Oh well. Keep your soul alive by looking for better, more interesting jobs. :-) This is only temporary.

It's too late anyway because I already signed. But I don't want to bring it up because this is the income they intended me to have been making all along. It's supposed to be a 37-hour work week, but I've been working an average of 42 hours a week. When I thought about it, I realized that's why I've been pulling down so much in take-home pay. I've been riding an hourly overtime gravy train. You can see why I would not want to mention it to them. It's just all the more reason to set their expenses in line with what they want.

Would your temp agency try to place you somewhere else? I would go to them and say that you are unhappy with the offer, and to find you another place to work. Go on temp to hire somewhere else. Don't lock yourself to a job that you hate. Believe me, everybody ends up hating some aspect of their job at some point, but if you start hating it from the beginning your worse off. Take the risk now while you have no attachments. It's harder to take risks when you get comfortable.

I don't have the option of remaining a temp, because this job was intended as temp-to-hire. My agent assures me the job market is very bad, especially since I am at the beginning of a new career that I was forced to change. The whole point of the job was to hire me-- if there's no hire, there's no interest on their part.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't companies that hire temps have to pay the temp agency almost double what the employee makes? So by hiring you on they are getting a serious break in cost, so they could totally afford to pay you more than the temp agency was paying you? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how this works.....

Unfortunately, I think you are misunderstanding it. For a certain period of time after they hire a temp away from the temp agency, a company pays a much larger percentage of a temps wages to the agency than when he or she was temping. It's in the contract they have to sign in order to get a temp in the beginning. So, they're paying much more money for me now; I am, I believe, receiving less of it.
