I have two free tickets to [Origins Game Fair](http://www.originsgamefair.com/), in Columbus, which is a week from today. They were of no use to me, because I can't afford travel and hotel. Mayfair Games is paying my way, in exchange for working for them, so that's how I'm able to go. Who wants them?
