For my personal website, [NemoRathwald.com](http://nemorathwald.com/), I have decided to write my own super-minimal content management system from scratch. Using Wordpress is a huge hassle for me, because it wants to be a blogging site with logged-in users, commenting, plug-ins, widgets, and lots and lots of features. I have to turn off those features and constantly work around them. I used to want a way to edit my pages in the browser, which was the great value of Wordpress. But now that I'm sufficiently comfortable with programming to be able to edit Wordpress templates, ironically, I no longer need that. All I want is static pages, with no commenting or other dynamic content. For a blog, I'll just embed my Livejournal. My pages will just be flat text files instead of a database, which my script will include into a template. You might ask why I would add another website project to my plate. So long as I am going to pursue web development as a career, and so long as I am not going to stop having a personal website, I may as well stop making myself look bad with obvious neglect. Friends keep sending potential clients my way, and I have nothing to show. Ideally I would never show my personal site to anyone who I work with professionally, but the scripts I will write will serve double-duty for a second site, [arnoldworks.com](http://arnoldworks.com), which will be my professional portfolio site.
