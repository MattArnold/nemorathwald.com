[Ginohn](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Ginohn/news/2004/0505.html) from [Looney Labs](www.wunderland.com) has linked to my [custom Gnostica deck](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Games.htm#gnostica)! Here's a link to the page I maintain about Bandai's collectable anime chess variant (really a Shogi variant) [Navia Drapt](http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/naviadratp.html). I've now learned it's scheduled to be released in [June 2004](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=152)!
