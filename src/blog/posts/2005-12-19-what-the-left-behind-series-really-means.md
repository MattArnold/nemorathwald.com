If you feel like getting really stressed out, check out [this article](http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Dec05/Bageant1217.htm) about the Left Behind series of books. Excerpt: “Jesus merely raised one hand a few inches and a yawning chasm opened in the earth, stretching far and wide enough to swallow all of them. They tumbled in, howling and screeching, but their wailing was soon quashed and all was silent when the earth closed itself again.” -- From Glorious Appearing by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins “The best thing about the Left Behind books is the way the non-Christians get their guts pulled out by God.” -- 15-year old fundamentalist fan of the Left Behind series That is the sophisticated language and appeal of America’s all-time best selling adult novels celebrating the ethnic cleansing of non-Christians at the hands of Christ. If a Muslim were to write an Islamic version of last book in the Left Behind series, Glorious Appearing, and publish it across the Middle East, Americans would go berserk. Yet tens of millions of Christians eagerly await and celebrate an End Time when everyone who disagrees with them will be murdered in ways that make Islamic beheading look like a bridal shower.

Stupidity is the root of all hypocrisy.

Oh, how wonderful it is to use violence to show people how best to love!

This article makes me long for the day that the American economy topples over so that these people will have something real to worry about. I'm afraid that until that happens we will have a series of SOB opportunists playing games with religious hate and fear. Go ahead, Christians. Surprise me. Save your religion from itself.

What gets me is that these same fundamentalists blast Catholics for acting in "unbiblical" ways and believing in unbiblical things when this sort of writing, at best, is purely speculative blasphemy of the worst order. That being said, I'll be more worried about the fundamentalist christian sort when they start suicide-bombing gay bars.(\*) Meanwhile, in Iran, we have a madman who will have nuclear capability soon, has been quoted in his desire to personally wipe Israel off the map (and regardless of your political views about Israel, the war that THAT would spark would make Iraq seem like a pleasant saunter in the park), and completely denies the Holocaust to boot. (\*) People always like to bring up at least 3 things in regards to a statement like this: abortion clinic bombings, Timothy McVeigh, and Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber). (1) abortion clinic bombings, while horrible, have been quite rare especially in comparison with the violence seen on a typical day in most countries. (2) Timothy McVeigh was not a fundamentalist christian. He was actually Catholic and never specifically renounced his beliefs. He never claimed a religious motive for his actions in Oklahoma City. (3) Ted Kaczynski was explicitly areligious and thoroughly an intellectual (went to school at UofM!), albeit a really f'ed up one.

Go to engines and put in "Pretrib Rapture Diehards" (& see item "1992") to observe LaHaye's gay hypocrisy. And there's more. The article reveals long covered up facts about the 175-year-old escapist "rapture" used by him and other Religious Rightists to garner millions from deceived millions for the RR's political agendas. The same wacko belief, which didn't take over evangelicalism much before 1909, has been riddled with dishonesty including plagiarism and subtle revision of 19th century documents. The RR will stay powerful unless mainstream scholarship finally decides to critically analyze 19th century primary sources which are now known and available! Jon
