Attention everyone. For Christmas I received "Monty Python Fluxx", "San Juan" (the card-game version of "Puerto Rico"), and two "Carcassonne" expansions: "Inns and Cathedrals" and "Traders and Builders". They are incredibly excellent. Let me know which of you would eventually like to play one or more of them with me!

definitely more (than one.) So, can you make the 4th?

I wouldn't miss it. What time should I be there?

any time after 10:30, and bring anyone that you want to. There will be plenty of waffles to go round. :)

that would be 10:30 in the morning. I _am_ bad with the telling details.

Matt, of course I'd be happy to play any of these.

Yay! Too bad you live so far away now and gas is so expensive. Perhaps you will be at one of the New Year's parties we are going to.
