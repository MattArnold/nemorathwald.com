I realized about a month ago that a purchase of a phone with a keyboard is actually a purchase of inclusion in the community of people who text message. It did not previously occur to me how much I miss out on that goes on behind the scenes with these devices. It's like in 2005 when Bill Putt dragged me into finally getting a mobile phone. I may have to stop thinking of a texting device as a luxury. Now, that having been said, until I have more secure income, I'm not going to run right out and purchase that social circle today.

For whatever little it means, I think that you should get a keyboard phone as soon as possible. :)

If for nothing else, the keyboard is worth its weight in gold for entering contacts.

Just thought I'd mention, it's quite possible to text with just a normal keypad -- my younger brother actually likes them better. Why? Because he can touch-type one handed on them, but he has to look at a full keyboard and use both hands. I might be making it up, but I think there is even a company that sells a 10-key keyboard that lets you use that cell phone layout to type on a computer -- geared of course to people like my brother who can actually touch type on one, but (unlike him) have to hunt & peck on a qwerty keyboard.

I use a normal phone keypad when I text... because I can text one handed on it easily enough. And just to give you an idea of how much I text... so far this billing cycle (ends 4/19/09) I've used 2227 text messages... I have an unlimited plan for a reason!
