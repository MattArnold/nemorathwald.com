Today [Underworld Comics and Games](http://www.underworldcomics.com/index.php) called me because Bandai sent them a demo kit of [Navia Dratp](http://www.chessvariants.org/other.dir/naviadratp.html). I was the one they had listed with contact info as that guy who had been nagging them about it for a year before it's release and promising to buy it. Well, they decided not to carry it and to give me the demo kit for free. A couple of months ago,[Gamers Conclave](http://www.gamersconclave.com/) in Louisiana contacted me to talk about their demo kit, and from the photos they sent I see that it has two complete starter sets, SRP $60.00. Awesome!
