[Cory Doctorow](http://www.craphound.com) asked to present a panel at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org) about "The Hidden Totalitarian Assumptions of I, Robot." I've been curious ever since he told me this. Now it turns out he's published [a new story about it on the Infinite Matrix website titled _I, Robot_](http://infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html). After the story he writes, "Last spring, in the wake of Ray Bradbury pitching a tantrum over Michael Moore appropriating the title of 'Fahrenheit 451' to make Fahrenheit 9/11, I conceived of a plan to write a series of stories with the same titles as famous sf shorts, which would pick apart the toalitarian assumptions underpinning some of sf's classic narratives." It's an excellent story but I still don't get the point. The money quote is probably this from a Eurasian missionary/secret agent to a Canadian cop: "You live in a country where it is illegal to express certain _mathematics_ in software, where state apparatchiks regulate all innovation, where inconvenient science is criminalized, where whole avenues of experimentation and research are shut down in the service of a half-baked superstition about the moral qualities of your three laws, and _you_ call _my_ home corrupt?" But as far as I can tell, some characters decided to be totalitarian dictators, and other characters in their society allowed them to be, for reasons which I can only dimly connect to the three laws or to Asimov's book, probably because it's been years since I read it. (The movie, which was a script called _Hard Wired_ until they slapped the _I, Robot_ name on it for no good reason, doesn't count.) Why don't the Eurasian robots, who are not "3 Laws Safe," run amok and take over the world? The story does not say. In asking that question, am I **making** one of the totalitarian assumptions of _I, Robot_? A few months ago I bought it [the e-book](http://www.fictionwise.com/servlet/mw;jsessionid=6n91WsC0BN26LbafSEZhQVNo0t0?a=rewrite&url=/ebooks/eBook17842.htm) from Fictionwise.com, but from [this LJ entry you might recall how Digital Rights Management screwed me out of my property.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/40860.html) I don't know if I'd call that totalitarian though.

I read the story. I got the impression that the government portrayed would have been the result of an Microsoft type company allowed to run amok/take over the government. In other words, "The only tech that's good tech is \*my\* tech, and I'm never going to admit that other tech is better, even if I use it in private". Techno-centrism at it's finest.

Hi Matt, I finally got around to reading the story and I was deeply disappointed with the conclusion. Without giving spoilers I can sum it up as Libertarian pap and completely unbelievable. Going after totalitarian assumptions in classic science fiction is like shooting fish in a barrel, but it is kind of pointless to try if the world you create flies in the face of all social science and human nature as Doctorow's Oceana does. From my standpoint this story wasn't science fiction, but bad political fantasy. Thanks, Lorrraine

If it's shooting fish in a barrel, maybe you can tell me what the totalitarian assumptions are in I, Robot. I'm not very political and don't understand most of the implications unless they're spelled out for me. (Now as for the Foundation series, that I can see without help.) I'm very interested in these topics. What outcome would have made the conclusion of this story believable for you? What work is Oceana from? Is that the title of a short story?
