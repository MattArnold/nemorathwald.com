The real-estate company and I have worked out a hiring compromise in which I will be a temporary part-time hourly employee for a month or two. I'll drive to Lansing on Wednesdays and drive back Thursday evening, with an occasional third day when necessary. The understanding will be that during this time they will be looking for a permanent staffer and I will be looking for other employment. They need me very badly right now, but are running up against institutional inertia when it comes to outsourcing and being invoiced per job instead of per hour. It will keep the wolves at bay for me for a couple of months. I'll have a five-day weekend in which to work on the website of that church that likes me so much; they have finally announced they plan to sign on the dotted line on May 19 for the website work. I'm driving to Lansing now for the afternoon to be trained during my predecessor's last day on the job.

I don't know if I should be happy for you. At the very least, it's income until something better comes along. On somewhat related note, I ran into my old boss from the Monroe Evening News while taking yesterday. To his credit he was amicable about the whole thing. If it wasn't such an awkward meeting, and if I had the presence of mind at the time, I would have probed a bit about the position. Sorry.

Nothing wrong with that. Any money is better than no money. And it gives you time to look for better. Also gives you a chance to meet more people on the job.

Glad to hear that pasting pieces together is going relatively well. (:
