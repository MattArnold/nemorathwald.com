Imagine Jen and I sitting in a room. She is working on writing software, setting up servers, [using asian cookware as a wireless antenna](http://www.instructables.com/id/%22Poorman_s-WiFi%22--USB-adapters-%26-DIY-cookware-refl/), or updating Linux on her Apple laptop which dual-boots Windows and Linux but not Mac OS. I am drawing pretty pictures on my laptop with my tablet. Guess which one of us gets approached by a stranger to ask for computer help? Me. This happens all the time. OK, get this. This is one of those situations where you simultaneously laugh and cry. Jen's friend who works at Best Buy told her they had seasonal openings for cashiers. So she applied online. Then she told me about it, and I did. When I came to the Unicru personality assessment, I had heard of [how ridiculously broken it is](http://www.timothyhorrigan.com/documents/unicru-personality-test.answer-key.html). I'm not saying it's a clever trap. I'm saying Unicru/Kronos got one over on Best Buy. Normal, conscientious, hard-working people who would make good employees-- such as Jen-- can't pass it because of the flawed test design. Only a manic, smarmy, passive, servile schizophrenic who cannot see shades of grey between "Strongly Agree" and "Strongly Disagree" could pass it. Or a mind-wiped Active from Dollhouse. ("I try to be my best.") Or someone who Googles for the correct answers. Guess which one I am. The next day, I got a call from Best Buy to set up an interview. She did not. \*facepalm\* Today I went to the interview. The interviewer kept saying I seem like a computer person. Instead of a cashier, they want me to interview for the Geek Squad. Jen has been trying to get into Geek Squad and they don't give her the time of day, despite being ten times as qualified as me. \*double facepalm\* I guess it's heterosexual skinny cisgendered cissexual young white male glasses-wearing privilege, come to my rescue again. Yay! In reality, it's that they think I am not sufficiently qualified to demand more than they pay, and Jen is. They think I can sell lots of RAM and gold-plated USB cords, and they don't think Jen can. In both of these they may be correct.

I've interviewed for the Geek Squad too and the impression I got was that they don't feel confident having women working for the Geek Squad since the typical computer guru is male and geeky; the interviewer tried to suggest I'd be better selling kitchen appliances. I guess the idiot couldn't read my resume. Okay.... Stupid Best Buy and its computerized testing. \*kicks Best Buy\*
