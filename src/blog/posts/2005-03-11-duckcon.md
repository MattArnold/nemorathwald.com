Oh, wow. After reading the DuckCon webpage about [Blinkies](http://www.duckon.org/blinkies.html) and [Critter Crunch,](http://www.duckon.org/critterRules.html) I wish so much that I had more vacation days. After Penguicon I'll have basically used them all up. Maybe I'll just get a Saturday membership to DuckCon, drive down late Friday night after work, and leave Sunday morning. I'd have to figure out some kind of crash space though.

As I said in my earlier post, I've only attended one Duckon, and I was only there for a grand total of 30 hours! We'd scheduled a Midfan meeting to take place at Duck, and I had to be there. But I'd forgotten that that weekend was Eric's birthday. So Friday night he and I celebrated his birthday, and Saturday morning I got on a plane to Chicago. Checked in, went shopping, hosted a ConFusion room party, went to sleep, had my Midfan meeting, ate lunch, and hit the road with to drive back to MI. It was quite the whirlwind adventure.

but not a bad trip... and I got some colorful hair out of it. :) Not to mention I [met a boy](http://www.livejournal.com/users/kittylad).
