I'm still waiting for laser cutter time, to see how it comes out, but I don't mind showing you the schematics now. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUri4ur4wwI/AAAAAAAAIUA/PCbUXGvZsa0/s400/BoardExtrude.png) The key on the robot's back is just for decoration, but the gears on the board really turn. I used this [gear template generator](http://woodgears.ca/gear_cutting/template.html). The gearteeth form a track along which the pawns move, and you can change where everyone is on the track simply by turning the gears. Here are the schematics for the gears and board. Red is cut, black is engraved. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUrj8hZJY3I/AAAAAAAAIUM/zgmh1RXovKQ/s400/GearboxGrabGears.gif) "GEARBOX GRAB" is a working title right now. I'm considering some other titles. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUrUKPGEcfI/AAAAAAAAITU/CmKt9PWrBu4/s400/GearboxGrabBoard.gif) I think you can't really laser-cut cards, because it burns the edges as it cuts them. But you can laser-cut chips and draw them from a bag. So that's what this game uses. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUrUKP_HpbI/AAAAAAAAITY/DzztILTmowE/s288/GearboxGrabChips.gif)
