To continue my last post: Speaking of the hotel, the concom went to visit the Livonia Holiday Inn Holidome last night, and it just filled me with good convention feelings from end to end. The lobby, although it is roofed and filled with couches, resembles a charming pedestrian outdoor street with an enormous cafe-style gaming area. The moment that I stepped into the beautiful atrium filled with tropical plants, garden brickwork, benches surrounding fountains, the first words out of my mouth were "the old Van Dyke Park hotel." Get this: the door to the non-smoking consuite is on the first floor of the atrium. In addition to the pool and games, the atrium has a putt-putt course where [The Chaos Toy](http://www.chaostoy.com/) can go. The hotel restaurant is an Irish pub decorated like something right out of Robin Hood.

That sounds awesome. Personally, my biggest concern is with the staff. An unwelcoming staff can make the best con hotel a bomb.

I've actually stayed at that hotel in a non-convention manner but found my dealing with the staff to be pleasant and they didn't at all mind the quirks of two computer geeks who camped out in their various lobby areas for several hours with laptops because the mood to keep working lasted longer than the room hours did. :)

I toured that hotel while hotel-shopping for ConFusion. It was my leading contender until I found the Van Dyke Park. I really liked it, but the function space was pretty tight. If I hadn't found the VDP I'd have tried to squeeze in there somehow, since it had so much going for it. If Penguicon can fit in the smaller function space I think it is a very good choice.

Do they still have that nightclub, "Tremors"? Or is that now the Irish pub?

Tremors is gone and is now the Irish pub, Shanahan's. And a fabulously monarchical throne room it has become.

Neat! How's the ballroom? And the really important question. Are the beds confortable?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Sep. 29, 2005 7:20 PM

There are two ballrooms, neither of which is at all ball-shaped. As for the beds, I didn't try them out.

I had my work Christmas party there last year. That place is great, althought there's always a ton of business exec's./travelers kids (ages 6-13ish) running around. They have great food there.

Just so we're clear, this is the hotel for P'Con 4.0?? I don't think it's been explicitly stated anywhere, and I wanted to double check. Personally, I didn't care for the Novi Sheraton/Hilton/whatever it was.

It was stated in the last post, of which (as you see) this is prominently labeled the "continuation." But no matter. This is indeed Penguicon 4.0, April 21-23 2006!

Irish Pub?? \*happy dance\* Yay! Ok. I'm happy now. As long as the beds are comfy. \*grin\*

Matt, are you doing the floor plan again? I can do the poster size printouts if you'd like.

**Anonymous** on Oct. 4, 2005 6:13 PM

Absolutely. I haven't got the floor plan yet, but I'll definitely take you up on this. Plus, now I have some easy-to-use 3D software and it might be better than ever.
