As long as I'm living here,Â  is giving me a sub-account on her Netflix account. I'd like to make use of the Friends aspect of the site. Who else is on Netflix? Add me with the username Matt\_Arnold or leave your username in the comments. [link](http://www.netflix.com/BeMyFriend/PptMAg0uEPywPat58AWc)

As I go to add friends, it seems to want an email address rather than a username. I COULD start guessing at which email address you used, but I don't particularly want Netflix to start spamming all your addresses in the hopes that one of them is correct. Instead, John and I are netflix@lodden.com.

Hey Matt, Feel free to also invite me to be your Netflix friend - self@brucewebber.us. (I know your email address, but I'm not sure how that works with the sub-account thing.) -- Bruce
