A learning game built on Wikipedia and Wikibooks. It could be that our problems will only be solved by education. We have unprecedented access to the world’s knowledge, so how can we promote its use? Some argue that one of the biggest motivators of the human race is “Prestige Needs”. The Wikidiploma game provides public recognition for using a public knowledge repository. A browser plugin records which pages a player has surfed to on Wikipedia and Wikibooks. Each player’s record of Wikipedia pages form a profile of their interests, within a declared plus-or-minus margin of error. The system matches them to each other for which Featured Portal on Wikipedia they seem to be the most interested in. Then there is Question Match. The game shows you a page that your match read, which you have proven your knowledge of during a previous Question Match. It assigns you to ask that person a question about a random fact on that page, to prove that they familiarized themselves with the content. Your match is shown a page that you read, which they have previously proven their knowledge of during a previous Question Match. Your match is assigned to ask you a question about it to prove your knowledge of that page. You are required to answer within the limit of a timer, and the plugin detects if you open up the Wikipedia page to cheat. Players get progress bars that measure proven completion of entire Portals of Wikipedia that cover content areas.
