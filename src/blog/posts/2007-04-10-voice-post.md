I've never tried to transcribe something before. It's extremely annoying. It won't let you pause the voice post if you play it with livejournal's interface (though you can open the voice post in real player, which I recommend if you're trying to transcribe). Then it froze on me and I couldn't type into it anymore. And now I can't figure out any way to go back and edit or add to the transcription.

I think if you go to [this link](http://www.livejournal.com/voicepost/transcribe.bml?user=matt_arnold&ppid=1071) you can type in a new transcription...which is less than ideal, but I thought I would mention it.

It's true, Livejournal's interface is unsuitable. When I do it, I tend to right-click and "Save As" the mp3 file, then play it in an independent sound player (such as Realplayer which you mentioned), while typing it into a text editor. Then I copy-and-paste it into the browser. But then, I've personally found transcribing to be a difficult knack to attain at the best of times. Thanks very much for trying!

It seems to have been cut off?

Yes, quite abruptly, the automated closure message started. Apparently there is a time limit.

I love fandom, just in general. I think the divide you're talking about is a function of location, mostly. Ann Arbor tends to have more affluent individuals. Although Oakland County has even more affluence, for whatever reason, the affluent areas of Oakland County have fewer fen. At least, fewer fen that are gregarious and attend many functions. Just IMHO, and I may be neglecting some obvious bit of information here, but since I didn't notice it, how obvious could it be, really?

If you are a chronic headlight leaver on, you should investigate getting a portable battery jumper thing. Eric had one until he got the Prius, which turns them off automatically, and it is a wondrous thing (that now lives in my trunk).

Thanks for the good advice. I did get one, and it stays in my trunk. There lies the problem, actually, in that it requires weekly recharging. As it turned out, this is more time consuming than it sounds, logistically awkward, and more difficult to remember to do than turning my headlights off.

Requires weekly recharging because because you use it that often, or because the charge dissipates? The one we have will hold a charge for a long, long time if it's not used, and is capable of at least a couple of jump starts before needing to be recharged.

The model I got dissipates its charge in a week. I might have an opportunity soon to pick up a used one super cheap, whose owners apparently have been satisfied.
