Friday, 7 PM, I'm on the panel discussion "Is this your first convention?" in Dennison III. Saturday, 7 PM, I will serve as the barista for "Cappuccinos with Cory Doctorow". My burr coffee grinder is adequate, but no longer grinds as fine as it used to. Does anyone have a burr grinder I can use? (Nothing using blades.) To head off the questions in advance, there will be no Cafe Penguicon at 'Fusion, just as there was not at 'Clave. They don't make enough registrations to pay for themselves, and the people who put them on are consistently stressed out about it. We'll have a fan table. I think our marketing dollars are better spent at events where we aren't known yet. That having been said, with the tight budget we have, it has been tough to figure out how to do a Cafe Penguicon out of state. Unlike some previous chairs, I don't have the income with which to pay for such a trip, let alone pay for the hotel room out of my pocket. I hope to work out a solution in time for Capricon, but we'll see.

I and my housemates will be at Capricon (not sure if we will be staying at the hotel - it's a much longer drive to the new location). If there's something we can do to assist, let us know. -- Brian (Evil Overlord of Coffee) out --

There is definitely a way you can assist! Rent a room and let us throw Cafe Penguicon in it.

I am looking at what it would take to do this. It would probably be just Friday & Saturday night. Any assistance would be welcome in actually running things, but I could get the room and do set-up. I can also supply coffee gear, plus some bar supplies if required. If there are any room party supplies available (tape, floor protection, decorations, etc.) that would save me some of the expenses. Will need to discuss w/housemates about doing this, but it does look possible. -- Brian out --

We have lots of room party supplies. I'll find out who all is going who might be willing to take supplies with them, or help run the party, and get back with you!

Chuck and I will definitely have a room at Capricon. Although Chuck will be very busy with Barfleet, anyone who would like to use our room to throw a party may do so, since there will be no going to bed early for us. I may be available to help on an intermittent basis, but I will also be with Chuck at Barfleet a lot, and most likely drunk in the evening hours :-p Incidentally, if one or two people would like to travel to Capricon with us, we MAY be able to make arrangements, depending on the situation. Drop Chuck an email if you're interested. As far as coffee grinder goes, I don't think ours is any better than yours, to be honest, but if you disagree, I'll bring it.

I'm definitely going to look into that. To my knowledge, Notacon doesn't have a party scene, but if it does, I'm interested.
