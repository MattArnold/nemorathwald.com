Bill Putt and I traveled safely to Columbus OH for Midwest Construction 3, a convention for people who run all-volunteer not-for-profit science fiction conventions in the midwest. (We stopped at the Novi Sheraton before we set off, and finally signed Penguicon's hotel contract! Awesome!) We had not been here two hours and commented we'd already got our money's worth without even attending a panel yet. I'm taking lots of notes and I'll make good on my promise to present a report Monday night.

I'm glad you made it safely. Congrats on getting the Penguicon hotel contract! :)

Thanks. Being negotiator (really more of a mouthpiece) for that was kind of a thorn in my side for the last three months. I have no naturally-occuring business acumen. But you know what? Somehow when it's for convention, I can enthusiastically do the kind of stuff that would bore me silly with any other purpose.

Hooray for making it safely! I hope you both continue learning and experiencing con! Kiss Bill for me! :) Oh, allrighty... hugs would be cool, and tell him I send kisses. Hopefully I'll get to call y'all sometime tomorrow. :) And ask Bill why he didn't exit Trillian before he left. His idleness and then sudden lack thereof and then away message going away and all the stuff that his Trillian does on random occasions is driving me crazy. I am looking forward to your full report of the con on Monday night. :) -Karen \*ze semi-paranoid and crazy g/f :)\*

Karen, I've never heard anyone snore so loud as Bill did last night.

rotfl... I usually don't hear him snore, 'cause I sleep like a log, and usually I can fall asleep before he starts snoring really loudly. :) Oh, and my mom used to snore louder than Bill before she was diagnosed with sleep apnea and given a breathing machine for when she sleeps. -Karen

Hi Matt, nice meeting you this weekend. Did you ever get comfortable with Euchre? Your face appears in some of my photos at http://www.midamericon.org/photoarchive/04construct1.htm Keith Stokes

Thanks for the photos, Keith. I wouldn't say I exactly got comfortable with Euchre. In fact it's the most boring game ever. But at least I was in very pleasant company. Were you there when Helen played two cards at a time and I said "what on earth are you doing?" After five minutes of their explanation seemed to make no dent in my ignorance, Chris Olson blurted out, "in computer terms, it's an optimization routine." "Oh," I said. Everyone in the room burst out laughing at how the light bulb instantly appeared above my head, me and Bill shook Chris' hand, and I said "My people!"

AHHHH!! Blasphemer!!! \*strikes you down!!!\* Euchre is the BEST card game EVER invented for a 52 card deck. You stop that horrible blaspheming!! I'm glad you eventually got the two card thing though!!
