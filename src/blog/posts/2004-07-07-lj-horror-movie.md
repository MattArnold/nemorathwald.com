Hey! I'm neither dead, a murderer, nor an attempted murder victim!

No, but you are a slut! :)

But I have several people who'd like to be on my to call list if I ever change that. (Don't worry, you're not one of them.) (:

Well, I may well be on the verge... after recent posts... ;) Interestingly, I was told by someone last week that if they do go gay, I'm gonna be the first person they call. And, for once, it's someone who I would actually date!

_Hey! I'm neither dead, a murderer, nor an attempted murder victim!_ You aren't any of those in 's LJ Horror movie either. All things considered it sounds like a good day worthy of livejournaling! ;^)

I wasn't planning to kill you, but the Internet is a powerful medium, and I don't feel comfortable questioning it.

I second the motion... let's get planning!

_I wasn't planning to kill you,_ Oh thank goodness, that means you didn't hear the Toad Elevating Moment last night. ;^)
