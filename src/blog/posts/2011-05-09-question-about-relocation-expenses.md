You remember Steve Eley of Escape Pod. I worked for him for a while as a remote assistant, and longer than that running PodDisc.com. He [tweeted a job opening](http://twitter.com/#!/SFEley/status/66309222861770752) at the web development company he now works for. When I contacted him, he said he'd talk to the higher-ups about whether there was a budget for relocation. I don't know how to react to that. What is that for? A deposit on a new apartment, I presume? Or a moving truck for the type of person whose belongings do not all fit in his car?
