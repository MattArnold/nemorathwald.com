Penguicon's programming schedule is now on the site in a list form, with complete blurbs, rather than table grid. There is still a link to the table grid, though. Proofreading is welcome. Oh, and I tend to host a ton of Penguicon images on my personal webspace so a bunch of the Penguicon website images are down because my webhost is b0rked. I've switched back to using Geocities for the crucial ones.
