Yesterday the replacement battery arrived for my Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop. For some reason, they gave me two of them! When I put in the new battery, my laptop turned on. Exultant, I turned it off and went to bed to let it charge. This morning it is having the same problem. When I push the power button, the computer does not start up. The battery light and hard drive light slowly blink red until I release the power button. Just as before, it will not run even if plugged in. Perhaps it is an overheating problem. Perhaps the reason it worked yesterday is that I didn't plug it in or touch it at all for a week.

Questions: 1) Did you leave it on while charging when you went to bed last night? 2) Did you observe that it gave you the "I'm drawing power from the wall" symbol in the system tray while you were using it, or was it running from battery? 3) If you plug in the third battery (but don't plug the laptop into the wall) does it work? I ask to narrow down two specific possibilities: 1) If the answer to 1 is yes, 2 is no (meaning you didn't notice or it was running from battery), and 3 is yes...it sounds like either your cable, psu, or the psu's attachment to the motherboard is at fault...meaning, power doesn't get TO the system, so as long as you have a live battery, you're ok (but you cannot charge the battery, because you can't get power to it) 2) If the answer to 1 is no, 2 is yes (meaning it was drawing power), and 3 is yes...it sounds like there's a problem with your psu that is frying batteries 3) If the answer to 1 is no, 2 is yes, and 3 is no...I have no idea, but it sounds sucky.

1) No, I shut it down. It was only on for the length of time required to boot into Windows and do the shutdown process. 2) I don't know. The battery never worked throughout the time I have owned it, so I always had to plug it into the wall. I've never seen the icon absent, so I'm not sure which one it is. 3) I just now tried that. I unplugged the computer, inserted the third battery, and the computer booted up. I am now getting as many of my files onto Jen's USB hard drive as I can.

Your laptop (internal) battery charger may be eating batteries (charging at the wrong rate, etc).

I had a problem with a Dell laptop once where I thought I had the battery seated, but it wasn't. The latch was closed and everything, but it wasn't all the way in. It might be dumb to suggest it, but make absolutely sure the battery is properly seated.

My coworker and I think it's likely the power cable has gone bad. We can test this theory out tomorrow at Kirk's. I will bring my laptop power cord. :)
