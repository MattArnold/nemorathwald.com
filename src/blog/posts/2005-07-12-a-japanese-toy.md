[![](http://www.engrish.com/image/engrish/god-jesus.jpg)](http://www.engrish.com/detail.php?imagename=god-jesus.jpg&category=Toys&date=2002-10-16) I present to you a Japanese toy called "The God Jesus." Notice the picture on the package of the boy praying for the girl and this Japanese robot cruelly denies him!

LOL. I love Engrish.com \*giggle\* I had a japanese roommate in college, and we used to laugh about all the stupid things we'd find in cross-culture translations... and of course, I somehow was the only person in our living center who understood her, even though she was speaking (heavily accented and somewhat broken) english... everyone looked at me for a translation. \*g\* We spent too much time together at the beginning of the semester... and I blame her for about 1/2 of my addiction to japanese culture.

That's hilarious. I guess the Jesus robot flashes one eye if you wish is granted and the other if it is denied. Looks like he can dip his head, maybe flail his cross around. How many Westerners have fat Buddha statues in their homes? I was told that the idea was to "rub Buddha's belly for good luck". Hardly reflective of mainstream Buddhism... "God Jesus" in reverse.

I WANT ONE! SO BAD! I spent too long in Japan. Not all that long, mind you, but too long to not get addicted to Japanese culture. Right now, there is a new Japanese student in my Friday night class. I'm the only one that can understand her (much like the other commenter), and I'm having a great time explaining American slang to her. I still want one of these.
