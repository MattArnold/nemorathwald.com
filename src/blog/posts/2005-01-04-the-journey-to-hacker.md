Reason #1. The ability to get good things done. The internet is a world I spend a lot of time in. I'll say to a friend "this page of our organization needs to say this instead of that" and they'll direct me to somebody who is a gatekeeper when I'd rather just have the power to Do It. I found out recently from Blasted Bill and that unless the cable company objects, a private consumer could actually host a web site in one's own home on a perfectly normal computer. My cousin revealed to me that a "web server" is a piece of software, not hardware. It even comes bundled with Linux! Not that it does me any good, yet. All too often (such as when I got a paid LJ account and looked at [the features](http://www.livejournal.com/developer/embedding.bml)) I read jargon like CGI and Apache and PHP which, until yesterday, I assumed to be a special type of computer hardware only available to ISPs. No longer will I slink away in defeat at their mere mention. Not even when [the so-called "Beginner's" Guide/Overview to Python](http://www.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide_2fOverview) contains gibberish like "object-oriented" and "regular expression" in its first few sentences. There's gotta be a class I can take, but how do I choose which one to take when programming, using a UNIX command-line interface, and web administration, all seem to blur together? Where does one of them end and another begin? Reason #2. Friends. So there are several problems that learning how to program will eventually solve, someday. But I want to be a hacker, at least an initiate, because wherever all the coolest and most interesting activities are going on, one half is cool and interesting and the other half is unintelligible. This is a sign that I have no earthly business not being a hacker.

I'm suprised to hear that you aren't one, actually. I'd assumed you were . . .

Yeah, everybody does, which is part of reason #2. I spent most of my life allergic to math, but I love playing around in chess variants and languages, which are sets of instruction rules. When I was in college I had a programmer friend, and we collaborated on games. I came up with the ideas and he programmed the ideas. From my elaborate charts for the decision tree of the artificial intelligence game opponents, he said I would make a great programmer. Too bad I always found it too intimidating.

This evening, we take a trip inside my library, and I show you the section on programming and web stuff. Web design is where engineering and graphics design intersect, and you're certainly well versed in the latter, the former will take some time and experimenting to master. So, no time like the present (assuming the Fusion programming book is complete, of course! :-)

Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... It looks like the best ratio of results to time expenditure will be to learn web servers. Programming, by contrast, is very discouraging, since: #1 It would take years before I become able to work on a project that's even marginally beyond useless. #2 Even if I make it that far, it's all been done decades ago. #3 Even if it weren't, I have no idea what projects I would ever want to accomplish with it. So I will probably never be a hacker, but at least I'll be something close. P.S. Then again, if you count coding new game plugins in the [Zillions language,](http://www.chessvariants.com/programs.dir/zillions/review2.html) (which I just found out is a form of LISP, whatever that is) as a form of hacking -- then never mind what I just said.

Configuring applications and writing glue scripts (scripts that stick modules together) is probably all you need to know how to do. As for LISP, believe it or not LISP predates FORTRAN and COBOL, but has been the darling or programmers for many years. Other variants of LISP are SCHEME and MONK. GNUemacs uses LISP as an extension language, so it doesn't suprise me it being used to write gaming modules. The old joke regading LISP, is that a computer science student is sitting in front of the terminal trying to comprehend why his LISP program won't run. The professor looks over the students shoulder, and seeing the problem, picks up the LISP language manual and whacks the student on the head, at which point the student acheives enlightenment...

Probably not what you had in mind, but I'm sure they have shorter seminars, also. And the CC in your area probably has something similar, although the [Internet Professional Department at WCC](http://inp.wccnet.org) has a seriously good program. Good luck!

I was going to give advice, and then I realized you have a whole convention of people who can teach you. Go to Penguicon. They'll help you. Some quick tips: \* Learn C. Everything else is based on C or some version of it. \* Install Linux. Play with it. \* It's like any other skill: learn by doing.
