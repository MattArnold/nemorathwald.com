[![jboselkei](http://www.nemorathwald.com/lojban/jboselkei.jpeg)](http://chain.lojban.org/jsk/) Martial arts offer various colors of belts. The chess community uses a system for ranking players. After much discussion, [Lojban the logical language](http://www.lojban.org/) now has [an online translation game named jboselkei](http://chain.lojban.org/jsk/) where Lojban-speakers can grade each other's translation attempts and track our overall scores. It will be a fun learning tool and will help to expand the corpus of usage examples. As the [FAQ](http://chain.lojban.org/jsk/faq.html) says: "jboselkei isn't primarily a rating system; it is a dynamic bilingual database of Lojban to which everyone can contribute." Designing a meaningful system was a challenge in sociology, ethics, and valid testing. The end result is promising! By harnessing the wisdom of crowds, jboselkei could end up being the best thing to happen to Lojban ever. Remember the scene from "Wayne's World The Movie" in which Wayne speaks only a word or two of Cantonese and the subtitle translates it as "The irony is, I feel partly responsible for her self-nullifying behaviour"? That text will be my next post to jboselkei.

I think I'll stick to my goal of re-learning Spanish, since I took two years in high school. Still a couple grey cells I haven't killed that contain information on it. And my nephew will be teaching me Ukrainian, as soon as he learns it. He's currently 2.3 years old, but has already taught me the words for light and juice.

Spanish is an extremely easy language to learn. I took two years of it in high school.
