[The latest episode of Pseudopod](http://pseudopod.org/2009/05/08/pseudopod-141-flash-on-the-borderlands-i/) is a triple-feature, and the second story in the episode is read by me! I warn you, it is deeply disturbing. You even get to hear me sing a song that you never thought could work on a creepy level. Pseudopod is part of the Escape Artists family of short fiction podcasts. Every week, [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org/) brings you science fiction, [Pseudopod](http://pseudopod.org/) brings you horror, and [Podcastle](http://podcastle.org/) brings you fantasy. This company is the second largest paying market for short fiction in the world, and with our growing listenership and the declining readership of Analog, is swiftly catching up to the largest. You can purchase a complete season or series on the website I operate, [PodDisc.com](http://poddisc.com/). My robot will burn the MP3s to CD or DVD and print it in lavish full color. I will lovingly pack and ship your product immediately by hand. Or download archived episodes individually for free, and if you enjoy them, please leave a tip in our Paypal link, or subscribe to a monthly payment of just $5 to support your favorite show.
