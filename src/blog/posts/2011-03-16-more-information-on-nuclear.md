[Here is an article by several MIT nuclear scientists about the Fukushima reactor.](http://mitnse.com/2011/03/13/why-i-am-not-worried-about-japans-nuclear-reactors/) It is a sober, neutral re-write and ongoing correction of an outraged rant written by an MIT business risk management researcher (previously falsely identified as an "MIT scientist" when his original article went viral). They removed his mistakes and toned down his conclusions. The page now brims with facts about how nuclear power works, how these specific reactors are constructed, and the cost/benefit trade-offs of venting temporarily-radioactive steam, or allowing hydrogen to build up inside the building where it then exploded. It also has a collection of updates on what precisely went wrong, and the levels and types of radiation released. While the Fukushima situation has serious potential to cause problems in the near future, I am still dismayed to see so many nations turning away from nuclear power. [A graph of how many people die for each terawatt produced by each energy source](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/2e5d4dcc4fb511e0ae0c000255111976/comments/2e70ae944fb511e0ae0c000255111976) shows nuclear power to be the hands-down winner.
