will have enough trouble fighting for the dignity of her dying grandmother without adding the topic of polyamory to her visit. The family is fundamentalist Christians, and therefore not allowed to know I exist. I spent all day yesterday in a motel in Denver, and am doing so again today. I can see mountains from the window. I wrote an interactive fiction yesterday. Please let me know if you would like to beta test it when it's complete! I have a lot more to add to it, so you can't play it yet, but here is just a taste.

The dimming of the light always heralds the return of the giant snake from the sky. The little thing that runs and runs inside you accelerates its pace, as the iron bars of your prison groan and swing open. "Little one! It is not a snake! It has never done harm!" But the rythm inside you never listens to you. It can know nothing but the monster. A monster without, a traitor within. Between them, the Cage.

**Habetrayal An Interactive Fiction by Matt Arnold Release 1 / Serial number 090226 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N) SD**

**Cage** You are in a cage. Beyond the bars, vague shapes loom in the sky. In the center of the cage is a wooden tub. A wheel is attached to the bars of the cage. Tunnels lead up and to the side. You behold the visitation of the titan god. >

Interactive Fiction is a wonderful medium. Best of luck with both this new project and the virtual Penguicon.

The traditional workaround is for her to introduce you as a friend (you aren't required to offer details about your friendship that they don't want to know about). Surely it makes sense that she would want a friend along on such a road trip.

I already introduced him to my family as a friend. The difficulty lies in the particular social situation: 1) He's currently living with me. My mother knows about it, but she thinks it is solely as a roommate -- after all, I've genuinely had male roommates with whom I haven't had romantic relationships with. 2) I chose to bring him to a significant family affair, implying that he means more to me than just a roommate. 3) Furthermore, I chose to bring him over my socially-accepted significant other. It wouldn't matter if my SO couldn't have come with me anyhow -- I know how my family thinks. 4) We're staying in the same motel room -- that's just a little too obvious a tip-off. Honestly, I couldn't have paid for two motel rooms for the sake of a ruse. My family can put two and two together. I think I'd rather not help them do the math... :)
