I am going to collect info here as it develops. Here is what is needed for Michigan to host a semifinals in the 2010 Rio Grande Game Design Competition, followed by more detailed rules, information, and links to resources. 1) U-Con is one week before the Chicago Toy and Game Fair, when Jay Tummelson will judge the finalists in the national competition. Therefore, if the semifinals are at U-Con, each contestant must either make tentative plans to get their own lodging in Chicago for the finals, or must be able to make such plans on one week's notice. Plan A: In the event that they can agree to that, Rio Grande will let us hold the competition at U-Con. Plan B: In the event we cannot get sufficient contestants who can agree to that, we would need to spin off an event to take place slightly earlier in the year. I bet I could convince i3Detroit to let us use their spacious facility in Ferndale, and get funding grants if necessary from AASFA and/or the Penguicon board. The issue with Plan B would be publicizing it to get enough attendees. Whereas U-Con has 500 people who are there for other things, even from out of state, many of whom would love to playtest. 2) We need an organizer other than me, because I'm going to compete, and competitors can't officiate. Here is what the organizer needs to do: Collect a list of names of those who agree to be playtesters. Announce two registration deadlines to local game groups: one for rules and graphics by email, another for physical prototypes either in person or in the mail. Receive and collect email and prototypes. Confirm with contestants that their rules and prototype are received and they are registered. Print out evaluation forms developed by Keith Meyers of GameDesignCentral.com based on Rio Grande's ten criteria. Attend U-Con and bring all the rules, prototypes and evaluation forms. You will also need a clipboard. Set out all prototypes with rules on tables in the middle of the dealer room. Hand out evaluation forms. Record the progress of each playtester until they have played each game. Collect evaluation forms, score the event, announce the winner. Return anonymized eval forms to contestants. Sumbmit results to Rio Grande. [2010 Contest announcement and info from Rio Grande.](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/524287/announcing-the-2010-rio-grande-games-design-contes
