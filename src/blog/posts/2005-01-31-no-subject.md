I recently saw a cool page that ranked LJ users by how often they appeared in the friends lists of my those on my friends list. I can't find it any more.

try this page: http://www.livejournal.com/friends/popwithfriends.bml There's a link at the bottom so you can include your friends. Is this what you were looking for?

Yes it is, thanks. How does one surf to that in Livejournal?

I'm not sure. Maybe through the FAQ? I bookmark things like that as I find them, but the community has pointers to tools like this.
