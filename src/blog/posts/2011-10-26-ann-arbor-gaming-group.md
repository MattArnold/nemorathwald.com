It turns out someone will be at Ann Arbor Gaming Group tonight, at Amer's on State Street in Ann Arbor, 7:30 PM, with a copy of Eminent Domain! (Rules on [this page](http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/65653/eminent-domain-english-rulebook-final).) I can't miss the opportunity to finally play it-- so I plan to be there.

I think you'll really like it. I've been pulling my copy out every chance I get since I picked it up a week ago.

We'll see. It's off to a rocky start. It was very slow-paced because two of the four players insisted on understanding every strategic ramification the first time they played, instead of just learning by seeing what happens. Most of the time, between their arguing over pointless rule nitpicks, we couldn't keep track of whose turn it was, whose "lead" it was, or whose "follow" it was. I'm going to try it again and see what happens.

As a Gaming Moron, that makes me even more comfortable about just jumping right in in the future :)

That's the approach I consistently support. It's all about fun, and that's all. I don't understand why I see so many people take one look at a game, and say "I don't understand." Why would anyone think they should understand a game just by looking at it? You're not a moron. You just haven't done it yet. No one understands it without being taught. Just like a stick shift, how fast you gain understanding of something is a function of how interested you are in it. You don't have to be interested in games! There's nothing wrong with any level of interest or disinterest. I don't want you to feel any pressure.

I think you can gauge whether or not you're a good new game person candidate by when you start playing, if you're not afraid to ask questions, and are enjoying yourself. But it's people with the attitude like yours- who are NEVER annoyed with anyone asking a question, are patient, and clearly have a passion for games- who make this possible and make it a really fun experience. So there's just a shout out for you being awesome like that :)
