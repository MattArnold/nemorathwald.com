[The EPCOT Central blog has a beautiful article on this auspicious day.](http://epcot82.blogspot.com/2007/09/on-your-birthday.html) Happy 25th Birthday, EPCOT Center! This park is unique in its vision as a permanent World's Fair of human knowledge, technology, art and travel. ![](http://allearsnet.com/tp/ep/dreams2.jpg)Museum of history, science and art. Innovation showcase. Living travelogue. Record-setting largest saltwater tank, man-made underwater environment. International festival of foods, wines, and flowers. Fine dining experiences to rival Paris. Music-synchronized fireworks and parade. Cheerleader of the human species and our spaceship Earth. Let's all congratulate the **E**xperimental **P**rototype **C**ommunity **O**f **T**omorrow on its first quarter century!  [Here are my previous posts about EPCOT.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/tag/epcot) Especially [this one](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/124334.html).
