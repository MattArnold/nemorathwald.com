I'm using only my Windows and Mac computers because my Ubuntu Linux box has some kind of problem: when I turn on the power supply switch, the fans spin up, then spin down, then spin up, etc. The monitor displays nothing. I don't know what's broken. It's my best and most-used computer. If I haul it along to the signage party on Friday, would there be time for anyone to take a look at it?

If you bring it to the Computer Lounge whenever, there's a good chance there will be someone there who can help you with it. My gut says power supply, though. Do you know if you have a 20 or 24 pin connector, with or without an extra 4, 6, or 8 pin connector?

You'll have to pardon my brain, though - it translated signage party into keysigning party. Which briefly puzzled me, but I let it pass. I need a new brain.

Sounds like a power supply. I might have one that'll work.. I'll try to remember to bring it.. if it's still alive, that is.

Might be a power supply, yes. But when is the last time you sprayed the fuzz out of the machine? In which I mean remove the CPU fan and spray the heat-sink clean. Also if the CPU fan died (happens) most newer MBs won't even boot. So, does it beep on boot-up at all?

I've never done that. It's been years. No, it doesn't beep.

I know nothing of hardware stuff like this, but I will hope that you have a good backup. My main computer is not working, and I would be so much more unhappy if I didn't have almost everything that had been on it.
