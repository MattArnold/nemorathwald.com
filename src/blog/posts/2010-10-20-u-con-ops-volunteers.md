I need volunteers to help me in the Operations center [U-Con](http://ucon-gaming.org/), Michigan's game convention at U of M, on Friday November 12 through Sunday November 14. Run the ticket barcode scanner, or check IDs against pre-registered badges. Work shifts are extremely flexible. I have a whole spreadsheet of times to choose from!
