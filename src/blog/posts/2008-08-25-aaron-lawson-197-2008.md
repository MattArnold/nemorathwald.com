My brother-in-law abruptly died tonight. The cause is unknown. One minute he was there, another he was gone. A few weeks ago he was hospitalized and put in an induced coma in intensive care for a bleeding stomach ulcer. But we don't know if it's related. I knew Aaron since college. He leaves behind my sister Emily and my seven-year-old neice Bethanne.

Again, Matt, I'm just so shocked this happened. I hurt for Emily and Bethanne - and the whole family. Just heartbreaking. I'm grateful that there seems to be such an outpouring of support for everyone, and I hope the family knows that we're here if you need anything as well. All my love, Anne
