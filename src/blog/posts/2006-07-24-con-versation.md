![](http://www.con-versation.com/ConVersation.jpg) Remember, this weekend is Michigan's new [relaxacon](http://www.stilyagi.org/fanspeak.html): [Con-Versation](http://www.con-versation.com)! It will be Friday, July 28 through Sunday, July 30 at the Crown Plaza (recently Doubletree, but was just sold) in Novi, Michigan. It's a big party with dozens of friends in a hotel all weekend! The focus of this event is the hospitality suite, hot-tubbing, swimming, playing games, and of course conversation. At-the-door-registration will open in the hotel Atrium at 3:00 PM on Friday. A badge for the full weekend is $30. One-day registration costs $15 per day.

*   Opening ceremonies with ice cream, 8PM on Friday. In the lobby, the Con-Versation Pope will lead a processional up to Consuite.
*   Orientation for Assassin game, 9PM on Friday. Only those who attend orientation are playing the game, so don't worry that you'll get ambushed with a sticker on your badge if you don't want to participate.
*   Gameboy Tetris competition, 1PM on Saturday.
*   "It's Dangerous!", 4PM on Saturday. Everyone hits balloons with lightsabers. Saber the moment.
*   Outdoor pool party, 7PM on Saturday. Remember when we created a vortex at the pre-party last year? Let's do that again!
