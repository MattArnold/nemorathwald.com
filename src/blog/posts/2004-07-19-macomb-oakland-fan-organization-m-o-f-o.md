This morning's commute was only ten minutes. I'm so excited about my new digs. Moving to Oak Park went fast and without complication. Saturday, my brother helped me move what little furniture I have. Sunday, Rachel helped me move almost all the rest of the stuff. Then Blasted Bill came over and fixed my computers and set them up on my housemate 's network. We went to Dairy Queen and picked up Narf on the way, since he lives only a mile away from me. As we discussed how many of our friends live nearby, we decided this vicinity would be the perfect area to have a northern addendum to Tuesday's at Tio's, First Thursdays at Amers and First Mondays at SideTrack. We might meet every other Monday if there's any overlap with SideTrack. For now, we'll try meeting 8 pm Monday nights at Denny's on Telegraph between 696 and 12 Mile in Southfield, beginning tonight at 8. I have named it Macomb Oakland Fan Organization, or MOFO for short!

Go, MOFO! I'm glad your move went so well. These get-togethers with your friends sound fabulous. Congratulations! I'm pleased everything is falling into placet for you! :)

Thanks K! Now that I have left behind puny dial-up internet, I'm amazed that I still get out of the house!
