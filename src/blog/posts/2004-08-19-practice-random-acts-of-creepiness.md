Somebody mowed our lawn. Including the back yard. I thought John did it. He thought I did it. \*theme from the Twilight Zone\*

I heard somebody mowing the lawn on the weekend. I think it was Sunday. I wondered at the time who it might be, but I didn't look. I figured the landlady must have hired someone. (By the way, this is Rachel.) :-)

It was me, Matthew. I drove over two hours just to do you the favor and show you that I can be nice to you, even though you flaked out on me regarding the picnic! :)
