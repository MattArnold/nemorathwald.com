(1.6 MB [PDF file](http://wishful.fileburst.com/creativetime.pdf)) A useful read, all the more so because it gets to the point quickly. I wish I could say the same of the nonfiction books that clutter my shelves. I don't make it through one or two chapters of the typical professional book, no matter how the topic electrifies me, no matter how much I respect the author. I get bored out of my skull, because the amazing central idea has to be fluffed out with filler to turn it into a publishable book. "Good grief, I got the point twelve examples ago!" I am deciding right now not to even try to sludge through them, ever. They will not waste one more minute of my life. I don't think I want to read any more professional books. Give me a quick pamphlet like "Time Management for Creative People" any day.

time management literature that wastes time is a fine example of irony.
