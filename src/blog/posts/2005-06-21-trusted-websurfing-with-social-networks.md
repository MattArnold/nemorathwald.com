_["There are over 8 billion web pages. Most of them suck."](http://getoutfoxed.com/) --Outfoxed_ noticed in my last post that I applied tags to it. Tags are important. Google succeeded because they realized [you can't hierarchically categorize the web like Yahoo tried to do.](http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/deathofhierarchy.htm) Unfortunately Google is getting inundated with people cheating its page-rank system. The web will soon depend on metadata, which usually takes the form of descriptive keyword tags. [But the only people who can possibly apply them to 8 billion webpages is... everybody.](http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html) Who here does social bookmarking? Post here with your bookmark page so I can browse it. Mine is at [http://del.icio.us/Matt\_Arnold](http://del.icio.us/Matt_Arnold). [del.icio.us](http://del.ico.us) is a service that lets you apply keyword tags to your favorite sites the way that [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) has tags for pictures. You can browse the [most popular bookmarks on the internet](http://del.icio.us/popular/) from day to day. You can even set up the popular list as a drop-down menu from your bookmark toolbar in [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com). (What? You're still using Explorer? No wonder your computer is infested with spyware/adware/viruses. [Get Firefox!](http://www.getfirefox.com) It is a thing of **beauty**.) Just like the web changed from something you browse into something you you search, now feeds are changing it to streams of delivered headlines that you subscribe to. [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) has a feed-reader built-in: on a page that offers a feed, just click the orange button on the lower right corner of the browser to subscribe. Another form of social websurfing is the [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com) extension [Outfoxed](http://getoutfoxed.com/). You get a new button on your interface that will let you rate a web domain as good, bad or dangerous. Your browser will access the reports of your friends who have the extension, so that a global network of votes and comments emerges.

Yay! Another social tagging devotee. If you haven't already, you **need** to check out [Technorati](http://technorati.com). You might also be interested in [my bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/rikhei/folksonomies) on folksonomies. And then we should chat about them, as I love talking about metadata and tagging. :) Also, I read something interesting yesterday that seems to echo what you said about the web being something you subscribe to. Hmm, link is [here](http://particletree.com/features/the-importance-of-rss). (And now I'm bookmarking it, because it took me awhile to find.)

OK, but you don't go on Instant Messenger much anymore!

I do, actually, it's just that I'm usually hiding because I have a completely irrational fear that I'll make an ass of myself in front of my friends. I'm much worse when it comes to phones.

I guess I need to add you on Outfoxed... I have my doubts as to the usefulness of it, though.

Do you have in Informer page? I don't yet, but hope to have personal webspace for it soon.

http://getoutfoxed.com/users/Wolfger You don't need personal webspace for it :-)
