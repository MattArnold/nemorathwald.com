I'd love to have [this do-it-yourself car computer.](http://www.hackaday.com/entry/1234000310056201/) It's removable and uses a touch-screen with onscreen keyboard, a number keypad, and voice control. It serves as a workstation, jukebox, and GPS navigator with speech output. The site says: _\* It’s not permanently mounted in the car. \* It doesn’t require (many) special parts or equipment. \* It doesn’t seem to overheat in hot weather, and fans run quiet. \* It’s not an electricity hog, and won’t drain the battery. \* It fits in a tiny car with a weak electrical system. \* It doesn’t use a DC-DC converter. \* It doesn’t require a screen (for basic functions). \* The system is about as cheap as a desktop computer. \* Runs in my car or anywhere else. \* Pinpoint my location on a detailed map. \* Plot waypoints on the same map. \* Play MP3’s, videos, games, etc. \* Function as a file server, with only power and USB WiFi connected. \* Function as a streaming security cam, with USB camera added. \* Scan for WiFi signals, with or without a screen (audio output). \* Function as a jukebox without a screen. \* Anything else a computer can do, anywhere it can get power._

One of the nice things about driving is that I can use it as an excuse not to do work. With this, my boss would call me up and say "Could you pull over and change this data for me?" No thanks.

How would he know you have it? This is one of the countless ways in which being a computer professional dilutes your ability to actually benefit from computers. Ironic, isn't it?

How would he know you have it? He's nosy. If I left it in the car, he'd see it and ask. If I brought it in to the office, he'd know.
