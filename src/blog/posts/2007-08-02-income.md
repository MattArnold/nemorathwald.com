The previous client to whom my agency had pitched me (the ones needing web skills in Farmington, offering 1.5 times as much money as I've ever earned) never made up their mind and hired anybody. They have left it open and undecided. Tomorrow I start my first temp assignment from this temp agency. They're sending me to an ad agency in Troy that needs Quark XPress skills. It's completely unknown whether this will be a one-day assignment or longer. This will not pay as much as Farmington, but nearly so! Now GLAR has just called me saying they need me to drive down to Lansing for two days next week to train another person. (Stacy agreed with me that she could do better, and she quit.) I told them I'd call back tomorrow when I know how long my temp assignment schedule will be. Hooray income!
