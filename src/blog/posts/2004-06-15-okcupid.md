Has anybody else seen this [OKcupid](http://www.okcupid.com/) matchmaking site? It's totally free and the personality inventories are fun even if you don't intend to find a match. I don't just mean it's free to try, I mean every part of the site is permanently free, including sending and receiving messages. It rated me as the Poolboy (Random Gentle Sex Dreamer) even though I think I'm better described as The Backrubber (Deliberate Gentle Sex Dreamer). The initial test that assigns this evaluation is about fifty questions. After that, you may take the "Improve My Matches" test. This is a list of 1,050 questions, delivered in random order, which you can take as many or as few of as you wish. The more of them you answer, the higher the percentage of confidence with which the site matches you. I've answered about 650 so the site claims to know me 96.5%. The key to "Improve My Matches" is that the 1,050 questions also ask you what your ideal match would answer and how important it is to you that he/she answers that way. Is it just because of my matching, or are most of the women on this site between the ages of 18 and 21? That's kind of frustrating.

I think you forgot your closing quotation marks on your href, but that might just be me. :) I'm going to have to check that site out, though. Maybe I'll spend all day tomorrow...

I gotta say... while I don't normally think any of these dating websites is doing anybody any good, this one at least has put some thought into it. The format of the questions is really impressive to me. Although I've only answered a dozen or so questions, I feel like what I'm being asked is important. Give me a couple more hours, and we'll see if I like any of my "matches."

Okay, remember I'm a math nerd, but this is my favorite question so far: _If the price of an apple was raised 50% and then decreased 50%, making it cost $0.75, how much was the original price?_

A dollar. Speaking of costs, I agree that it's a better site than most, because free is my favorite price. I almost said with a straight face that on this site you get a lot of bang for your buck. Then I realized from a certain point of view it doesn't work out that way!
