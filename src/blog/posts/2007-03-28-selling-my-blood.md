My mobile phone service is back on. They took an automatic payment just when I had deposited barely enough money to instruct my car insurance company to make a withdrawal. So that bounced again. The insurance policy will be canceled on April 8 unless I find another short-term loan by that date. I am rapidly tapping out my known sources of short-term loans. I have made up my mind to sell my blood. It's great to be making an income again, but I expect to be dead-broke for a while. Carpooling is a cost-cutting measure, but still, the curtailment of life has been severe. The first reason, naturally, has to do with catching up on two and a half months of bills that piled up without income. The second reason is that I spent six years as a salaried employee being paid just to be in the office and available to my co-workers. Just so long as I got the tasks done, I could plan for a specific income on payday. Now that I'm hourly, I have started tracking how I spend my time, and am discovering just how little of that time I actually spend working. 30 hours a week, to be precise. (Especially now that I spend so much time on the road driving to work instead of getting paid.) This will result in small paychecks until I learn how to structure my time to make sure to do forty hours of paying work in a week. I have to give up posting here as often, and I have to give up being available to you at a moment's notice to put out fires with Penguicon as they arise. If you post something about your life on your Livejournal, don't expect me to know about it, because I have had to stop reading it. It's upsetting, but for as long as I'm doing hourly work in a customer-service industry, that will have be the case.

Struggling with finances sucks. I have been there, trust me. I've never actually sold my blood, but I did try to sell my eggs. Unfortunately, people willing to pay for eggs don't want to deal with a genetic history of mental illness. Anyway, I want to remind you that if you spend 5 minutes every hour doing something non-company-related, I would still consider that billable time. When it comes to hourly labor it's all kind of a matter of slant, if you know what I mean. I used to work hourly, and I had to write down what I spent all of my time doing, too. You just add in that extra 5 minutes because it's expected that you weren't 100% on task the entire 8 hours. Just my 2 cents.

I'm know you told me where you're working (location) now but I've forgotten. If my place...(very close to my old place) is closer than yours you are welcome to couch crash if it would sooth your drive. Give me a call. Hugs- Anna
