We left Saturday afternoon, and accepted an invitation from my friend Sarah Elkins to stay at her place in Maryland Saturday night. Sarah gave me a free [XO subnotebook PC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1)\-- a creation of the "one laptop per child" project. I have wanted one for years! Sarah is a great enthusiast of OLPC. Her friends kept giving them to her, so now she has five. It has already been really useful to me as an e-book reader. When you turn the screen to black-and-white mode, it's easy to read in the sunlight, and uses hardly any power. Yesterday we chose to avoid toll roads going from Maryland to Massachusetts. So, the GPS took us on a huge loop around New York City: first all the way up to Albany New York, then east through Vermont and New Hampshire, then south to Massachusetts. Many hours of the trip were through residential streets winding through treacherous terrain, in the rain, with no light anywhere but from our headlights. I'm waiting now in a Panera Bread while my traveling companion is in a job interview. If they ask him for a second interview here, it is uncertain when that would be. I told him if that happens, he has to put me on a bus home. I need to start packing for my move no later than Thursday. I plan to move on Saturday.

Sadly, no. The Firefox web browser under Ubuntu refuses to trust risky routers such as provided by McDonald's or bus stations. I intend to correct that Real Soon Now.
