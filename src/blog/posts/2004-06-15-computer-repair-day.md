Blasted Bill came over yesterday and spent all day on the issues I'm having with all three of my computers. Great progress was made. Whoever gave the free MEPIS Linux computer which he gave me had left the admin user profile locked with a password, which explained why I was unable to do anything. Bill circumvented this by getting my copy of Knoppix to work. Knoppix is a build of Linux which runs off a CD without touching the existing operating system installation. The people who gave it to me had burned the whole ISO onto the CD as a file within a folder, instead of as the disk image itself. While in Knoppix, Bill was able to access "root" and reset the MEPIS Linux password using lots of impressive-looking command lines. It turns out a faulty hard drive in the G4 Macintosh is to blame for its failure to boot up. Bill got it working intermittently, and on top of that, installed the hard drive out of my old PowerMac 6500 which I haven't used in years. This doubled the disk space. Bill updated my anti-spyware to solve the adware issue I'm having on my Windows box. When he left I started downloading Windows update. The spyware came back and keeps interrupting the download while I'm away. Almost twenty-four hours later it's still about six-sevenths of the way complete.
