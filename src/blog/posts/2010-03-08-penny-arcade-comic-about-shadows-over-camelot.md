[Penny Arcade ran a comic](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/3/5/opposite-poker-face/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+pa-mainsite+\(Penny+Arcade\)) that might be the best possible advertisement for the cooperative board game [Shadows Over Camelot](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15062/shadows-over-camelot). The [Battlestar Galactica](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica) game has a similar appeal, as does the bioterrorist element of the [On The Brink](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/40849/pandemic-on-the-brink) expansion to [Pandemic](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic).
