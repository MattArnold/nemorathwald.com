I recently read an interesting multi-page essay on the web about stress in the workplace. The author said that stress activates parts of the brain that cause an intense narrow focus on hammering out tasks. But stress switches off the part of the brain that looks at the big picture with initiative, the part that makes creative associative intuitive leaps and strategic planning,Â that are necessary for quality computer programming. He also said workplaces tend to unconsciously bring everyone to the same stress level and kick out those who don't conform to that stress level. Unfortunately I can't find it anymore, so please send the link if you have it. I had an interesting and profitable insight last night.

There is a stereotypical humiliation dream. You're back in college or high school, and it's the day of final exams-- whatever day was the high-pressure day. In the dream, you realize you didn't attend any classes all semester and you don't know even one fact about the subject you're testing on. Also, you're naked. Well, when I experience stress or pressure, my emotions undergo that dream in waking life. It feels like a crisis when it isn't. The perspective vortex doesn't last long. Sometimes just a day. For instance, after a very nice conversation with

I can look calmly at the ConFusion program book and the project doesn't look like a botched abortion. I currently don't predict the reactions of others to be as severe as it seemed yesterday. What I've noticed is that I consistently fracture along this fault line under pressure. In my overall life goals, this is probably the area I should focus on. Stress-aversion reactions are going to hinder a lot of goals. It's good that I recognize the crack-up for what it is, but that happens after the fact. At that point, I've done some damage that will put a ceiling on my achievements. I can see where it was a problem in previous workplaces. I should look for books on the topic if I am going to work through preventative measures. Perhaps it's possible to set up some kind of external process that would send me a text message when it's happening. I'm not sure stress biometrics are really ready for home and office use, though.

"Stress biometrics" sounds like a very marketable product, though, don't you think? One of the things I've been interested in lately is reading Buddhist literature on self-awareness. I'm not interested in the religious aspects of it, of course, but the practice of pausing to simply observe my actions without judgment has proven somewhat fruitful in learning to manage stress without blowing things out of proportion. I don't know if this is something that interests you, but the current book I'm reading is _Radical Acceptance_, by Tara Brach.

It becomes easier to notice the precursors, now that you've noticed the pattern itself. I managed to see it in time to quit the last job I was at honorably, instead of screwing things up and getting fired (as I have previously).

........ interesting. Do you happen to have the link to that essay? I've been bemoaning the fact that my entire office has fallen into a short-term view of everything. I assume (probably correctly) that it's largely my own fault, as I'm ultimately the one in charge (ergo, everything is my fault at some level). I just didn't fully understand why.

I have continued to search the web for the essay, but still cannot find it. If I do, I'll make a post about it.
