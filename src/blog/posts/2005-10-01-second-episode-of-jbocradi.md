I've put up the second episode of jbocradi, my podcast which is mostly in English about Lojban, rather than all spoken in Lojban. I made [a spiffy new webpage](http://nemorathwald.com/jbocradi/jbocradi.html) for it. Gotta show off my skillz in Cascading Style Sheets. In this episode: Pronouncing "o" The Holoalphabetic Sentence Phrasebook Part 2 Lojban As An International Auxiliary Language The webpage looks the way it does in order to try to communicate through association. That's why, on every new journal entry, I put a Photoshopped image from various types of mechanical puzzles, and that's why I put that opinionated little editorial in the sidebar about incompatable file formats. I have to compensate heavily for the fact that the fastest way to get someone to run away and never come back is to speak something other than their native language. Tempting someone to try a new thing (assuming they are part of the target audience at all) requires quickly planting a seed in their imagination. It requires associating it with some activity, philosophy, or group, that they might already like. If they aren't in the target audience, at least this will make them friendly toward it.
