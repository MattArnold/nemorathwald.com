You know what? I am the master of my fate! I am the captain of my soul! Fuck depression! I am going to send this email and hold my ground on telecommuting and a wage I can live on, as an independent contractor, or I'll keep looking! Fuck "no choice"! Fuck it with a broken-off broom handle! Of course I have a choice! I can choose to take this job and shove it, fuck this game, I don't play that! If I have to I'll move in with my parents and attend their (\*&(\*^&(^^%%^%#^$%#%# church and blow spitballs from the back pew and play "BINGO" with the logical fallacies in the sermon! [Bloodied but unbowed!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus) Name Redacted, Thank you very much for the interview today. After very serious thought I have decided to return to two issues: telecommuting, and compensation. It's a great sacrifice to be separated on the long term from all of my friends and loved ones in the East of the state whom I consider my family. $27,000 is not sufficient to live on or commensurate with my qualifications and experience. Would you consider outsourcing as many tasks as possible to me as an independent contractor? As an independent I could take other jobs with which to bring in the remainder. I would be happy to come in to your office every day for the first few weeks to get to know your staff. Then I could complete all tasks during my own hours, and still be on call to your realtor members through phone at any time. Otherwise I must keep looking. Thanks again for considering me. -Matt

YAYY!!!!! Im so glad to see this. You are stronger than you might think, and have more resources around in the shape of friends and loved ones than you might suspect. After all, it's what friends are for.

That was a good email to send. I totally agree with you. You have to think about your own long term happiness no matter how hard it is to fight against the constant outcry from your hindbrain that your safety is in question. In truth, your safety is NOT in question UNLESS you take a job that would effectively ruin your life. You have friends and family, and even if times are difficult, we will find a way to make it work.

That is a cool poem. Never read that before. Very inspiring. On a more practical note, I've found that places that don't allow telecommuting either don't or can't trust their current employees to put in a full day's work from home, or have a strong need for teamwork which easier to foster face-to-face. From your earlier posts regarding your work for Ideal Solutions, the first doesn't apply, and from my work on the con with you, I haven't found any communication issues with you via e-mail and IM. I believe you're right, this company might not be the perfect fit for you, even if the job is right. Compromise is sometimes necessary in order to move forward, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice your everything at that table.

Fantastic! I am pleased that you're not going to sell yourself short, that you're not going to take a wage that won't support you just to have "something". Something, surely, will come as a result.

Congratulations! Find the job that fits you. It's out there somewhere. You can live in our spare room for a while before retreating to your parents. Of course, we're out here at the end of the known universe, too. :-)

Matt, you're an inspiration to bull-headed geeks everywhere. Keep your pecker up.

Ya know. With all the conventions you work on, you should look for work in that field. You definitely have the resume for it.

I have to second this. It's always seemed to me that you're the hardest-working person in Penguicon. Before, during, and after. Perhaps some sort of event coordination is in your future?

Yeah, $27K is crap in this century. Hope you can find something worth taking.
