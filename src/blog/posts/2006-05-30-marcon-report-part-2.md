I should have volunteered to be a gopher at [Marcon](http://www.marcon.org/). I was in the sort of state of mind that required a project to work on. As it was, I became bored and didn't make many friends. I kept thinking about what I would be doing if I were at home, such as playing with the ferret which 's friend Pat dropped off for the weekend; or working on [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/); or the sculpture; or my new Lojban website. I ended up in the film room watching movies to distract myself, which is a bad sign. I'll be sure to keep this in mind about myself for the future: working on conventions is more fun than just being at them.

As much as I would love to, I just don't have the money.
