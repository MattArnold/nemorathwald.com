That didn't take long. I guess tomorrow morning when the repair shop opens, I'll find out how much expense I'm looking at. I hope it's less than the amount of money I own. Good thing I like buses. :)

You can start from a stop in second - if you're careful. Which you're not :) (Trans rebuilds are very labor-intensive - not worth it on a car that you paid this little money on to begin with.)

You mean I can't just replace the clutch? Or does the whole transmission need to be replaced?

Depends on what went wrong. Sure, you can replace the clutch. But if the gears inside the transmission are what have actually failed, then it won't do you any good.

Or, it could be something like a leaky clutch master clyinder or slave cylinder. Master cylinders are easy to replace, slave cylinders may or may not be depending on the vehicle architecture. Leaks can easily be solved by keeping a bottle of brake fluid in the car and topping off the reservoir every couple of days.
