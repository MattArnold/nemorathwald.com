Sorry I'm not gonna make it tonight. Dinner with family was tonight, and to bed early for Ren Fest tomorrow. Was I dreaming or had you originally said something about having a party on the 10th? Or are you still having a party then?

That was the original plan. By the time I announced the party on the lists, it became the 4th, because I can't have a party on the 10th.

Well, I'm sorry to hear I missed it. I was hoping there was going to be another one, but apparently that is not to happen. Stay tuned for invite to my b-day party on Friday night. :)
