[![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/matt.mattarn/SFgZOMUkgdI/AAAAAAAAC90/RsB4fG67JBY/s144/firefox-eating-ie.jpg)](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) Guess what today is? No, I mean the other thing. Today is Download Day! Version 3 of the Firefox web browser is released today. It's June 17, and I think something happened on June 17 thirty-four years ago, so some people have been calling me today to ask what presents I would like. I want Firefox 3 to break the record for most downloads in one day! If you already use Firefox, you know how much better it is than Internet Explorer. If you still use Explorer and you're tired of viruses, popup ads and slow load times, here is [why to join the 20% of the marketplace who have switched to Firefox](http://www.switch2firefox.com/whyswitch/). It is free, forever, so Happy Download Day and enjoy your browser! [Go here to download Firefox 3 before the day is out](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)! www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/firefox3 has more to say about this record-breaking goal, but as of this writing, that site appears to have crumpled under a massive load of traffic. I think that's a good sign. Happy Download Day to you Happy Download Day to you Happy Download Day, dear Fiiiiiiiiire Fox Happy Download Day tooooooooo yoooooooooou

Possibly good, or possibly they didn't think about the onslaught this was going to cause. :)

I'm wondering what virus there is that will affect you, that won't affect those who wait until tomorrow... maybe I'm too paranoid....

Happy Firefox day to you, and that other thing today also.

I wasn't planning to download Firefox 3.0, as I'm still quite happy with Firefox 2. But as a gift to you, I went and downloaded it. No promises as to whether I will install it for a while, because I'm really really lazy and I hate having to reconfigure options (Firefox 2 didn't keep 'em from 1, so I have few hopes that 3 will keep 2's) Happy birthday, too.

1.5.0.12. I tried running FF2 but it broke -- I have magical powers and can break Open Sores software with a sideways glance (Ubuntu? Pah. Black screen of death no prob.) I'll maybe upgrade to FF2 when it's properly debugged and the oddball plugins I use have been patched.
