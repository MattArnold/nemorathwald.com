Yesterday I woke up at dawn on a Sunday morning, to mistakenly show up a week too early for a gaming party. Friends forgive me for this. (I know, because I've shown up a week early to many events.) However, this was going above and beyond. While surprised in their bathrobes at 10 AM on a Sunday morning, Zach and Hilary sincerely welcomed me and said they were going to play board and card games anyway and it's more fun with three. Pretty soon we wanted to play a game that required more than three players, so I called Ann-Marie and Brian. Anne-Marie was busy, but Brian was happy to drop by, so I went to the party store, and the impromptu event became even more awesome. So awesome that we decided to do it again with even more people, in exactly one week. What a coincidence.

The correct response is clearly, "well, let's just play boardgames _until it's time for the RPG to start_." :)

Mucho awesome, I'd say! Although I have no idea how you managed dawn after Saturday night's gaming! I was completely useless the next day, despite the blast I had then.
