Thanks so much for posting this! I had never seen the Discovery Channel commercial before I read your post, so I didn't really understand the xkcd parody when I first read it.

In that case, you may enjoy [xkcd explained](http://xkcdexplained.com/). I intend to consult it from time to time as I do not always get xkcd.

Interesting web page (i.e., xkcd explained). But I find that it explains so much that it kills the humor, even when the explanation is welcome. (How many times did he have to say, "Note: the author feels that women are superior to men"? He may have intended the repetition to be humorous, but it didn't strike me that way.)
