My company is closed this whole week to give us all a holiday break. I'm mostly spending it working on the ConFusion program book. I need to get a clearer concept of how much time it takes to do things. The problem with overcommitment is not that I spend too much of my time on volunteer work. The problem is that the work is done better when it's properly time-budgeted for instead of rushed at great expense and at the last minute. I feel terrible that Blasted Bill has to be the one to create the Penguicon mailer.

I have problems with procrastination too... you should have seen me try to do all my Spanish 101 projects all in three nights... very hectic to say the least. At least Bill has two great editors on hand at (nearly) all times. :) ~K.

Thanks! I'll send you a proofreading draft of the program in a couple of days. You rock!

And I never did get with you to put something together to announce the Stilyagi spring dance. Do you have space set aside for it? If so I will try to get something together asap, otherwise we had best just let it go, I guess.

Now is a good time for that. But I'm much more concerned about getting biographies and pictures of GoHs, specifically Mr. Shetterly and Ms. Bull. I have nothing to use as even a vague or poor substitute, and I know nothing about them. Can you help with that, as urgently as possible?

I just wrote to them and asked.
