[![](http://www.notacon.org/g/community.jpg)](http://www.notacon.org/)![](http://www.notacon.org/publicity/nac5wide.png) On Saturday, I'll have to miss the last Penguicon concom meeting because I'm going to man a table and promote Penguicon at [NOTACON](http://www.notacon.org/) in Cleveland. For the last couple of months, I was struggling to arrange for Penguicon to preregister me for this out of my 2009 promotion budget, until it was too late and [NOTACON](http://www.notacon.org/) prereg had closed. However, I had forgotten all along that I registered for it at Ohio Linux Fest back in the Fall! So it's all set. I only have to figure out where to inexpensively park the car. I'm looking forward to seeing friends and making new ones.

It reminds me in some ways of [EPCOT's Millennium Parade](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/197948.html). I eagerly signed up to help operate the puppets. Be there on Main St. between Washington and William from 4 to 5 PM to witness the spectacle!

If you're actually staying at the hotel, it's not terribly expensive to park. See you there!

I might borrow crash space in order to not have to drive back to Detroit in the middle of the night, but I'm not a registered guest at the hotel.
