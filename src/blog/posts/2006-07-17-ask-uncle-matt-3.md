It's time once again for the twice-annual "Ask Uncle Matt," the part of the blog in which I delight and confuse you. Past installments are found [here](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/73302.html) and [here](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/110537.html) for your amusement. Send anonymous questions of a humorous or non-humorous nature to matt.mattarn@gmail.com. I suffer from an advanced case of MAS, Male Answer Syndrome. No question is so difficult that I can't make something up.
