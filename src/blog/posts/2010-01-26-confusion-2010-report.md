I am pleasantly surprised that the program book content I was given was mostly accurate. Apologies for having cast aspersions on its veracity. When I put that much work into one of the biggest expenses of the convention, I want it to be useful to attendees. It is stressful and demoralizing to me to have conflicting documents, and obvious clues pointing to a lack of attention, which undermined my confidence in the team during that process-- particularly since I've seen programming teams waste my time and the con's money so often in the past. Fortunately it worked out for the best this time. The crew of the airship Zephyrus is a steampunk costuming group (pictured [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wmdyer/3569095436/)) which holds auditions for a cabin boy at most of the conventions around here. This time I auditioned and was chosen! Speaking of elevating my pulse, my Dominion tournament was an adrenaline-packed thrill ride. I will describe it in my next post. I spent most of the con in the game room. Man of a Thousand Names provided his Random Acts of Random yet again. One of the missions that this game gave to Bahb (son of Bob) Brodis was to invent and propagate a new catch phrase. To help Bahb in his mission, I will use his new catch phrase now. I may have missed an opportunity to "flip the flippy floppy" this weekend, because I have trouble distinguishing flirting with intent from regular con behavior. On to Sunday. My slide presentation on marionette construction was at 10 AM on a Sunday, while the convention was sleeping or packing. (That was the available time, and I was the one who agreed to it, so I'm not complaining.) It attracted two people, and an additional two near the end who I think were getting early seats for the next panel. One of the attendees, , has experience with marionettes and is interested in collaborating on constructing them for the next play. During the rush to get out of the way of the very popular panel, I left my laptop and drawing tablet connected to the projector. The wonderful hotel staff brought it to me at Consuite during the dead dog party on Sunday evening. I discovered today that they missed the pen, so I will have to go back.

Did you remember to get your socks from the Gripe Session?

Yes I did, and also my toothbrush. And what a gripe session it was.

There was almost as much praise as gripes. Hours and hours of it, in fact.

I'm hugely amused that the gripe session sent a representative out to tell us folks jamming in the hallway that we were too loud and needed to quiet down. Griped at by the gripe session. :) However, y'all missed an awesome jam session too. Cello, baritone sax, recorders, and doumbek. It was awesomesauce, just like most of the con itself.
