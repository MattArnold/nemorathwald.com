That was the most stroke-like non-stroke I've ever heard of. It turns out there is more than one disease that can cause speech loss, headache, and funhouse-mirror vision: migraine, and transient ischaemic attack (or "mini stroke"). She'll follow up with a neurologist, but is home now. Thanks to everyone who called or posted.

I came late to the game, but I am quite glad to hear that she's pretty much okay.
