I'm LMAO. You've got to read this parody article on Locus Online: http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Features/0401\_Stross.html _Charles Stross Attains Posthuman Status "... Aussie critic and potential "Spiker" himself, Damien Broderick, comments, "I tried to visit \[Greg\] Egan years ago, and found myself stuck in a timelike infinity loop once I got too close to his nominal address. Only the concerted efforts of Stephen Baxter, Vernor Vinge and Greg Bear were able to free me."_
