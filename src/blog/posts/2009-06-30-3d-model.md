In preparation for moving an apartment into a single room, I have been modeling the room and its proposed contents in Sketchup. As you can see, I modeled the possessions with rather more detail than was strictly required. No doubt I will continue to do so until there is some kind of addiction intervention. Jen did not expect that I would increase the verisimilitude any farther. But oh, how incorrect that was. I did not like the stock human figure that comes with Sketchup.

This virtual reality may have ripped the fabric of space and time, and several other fabrics as well.

Oh just curious about what you would do with your large amounts of stuff.

We're going to sell a lot of it at my family's combined yard sale this month, and after that, sell as much as we can on Craigslist.
