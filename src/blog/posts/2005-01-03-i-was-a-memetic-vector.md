It was recently pointed out to me that according to [the transcript of United Universists' live chat with science journalist John Horgan,](http://universist.org/johnhorgantranscript.htm) I'm the one who gave him the word "Horganism" to use in his New York Times Op-Ed article about us. It was read by millions. The novel _The Religion War,_ by _Dilbert_ cartoonist Scott Adams, [which I journaled about recently,](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/32781.html) involved someone called the Prime Influencer. This character unknowingly tips world opinion by giving a catchy phrase to a few influential friends. It seems slightly more plausible now... ;)
