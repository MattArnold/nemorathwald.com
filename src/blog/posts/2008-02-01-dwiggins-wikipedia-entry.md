I have edited the Wikipedia entry about the man who coined the term "graphic design," [William Addison Dwiggins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Addison_Dwiggins), to include a paragraph about his magnificent accomplishments in puppetry. The absence of this information was a terrible oversight, which has now been set right.
