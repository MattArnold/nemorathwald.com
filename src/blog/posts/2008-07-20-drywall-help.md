At Jen's apartment in Wixom, I slipped in the shower while reaching for a towel and landed on my butt. I'm fine, but the towel rack didn't fare as well.

unscrew it, attach it slightly higher or lower, and fill the hole. spackle will do it.

Ah, I was thinking of just using a different style of anchor and the same spot on the wall. But that works, too.

Not that hard, usually. If the right side is loose at all, you'll want to replace the anchors on that side, too, so take them out. If the left side of the bar doesn't cover the wall-damage completely, and it will take more than paint, go get some fast-drying spackle to cover the damage and then paint after it dries. If the bar covers the problem, just get a couple of drywall anchors that will fit the bar and stick them in the wall. If you were to come by here today, I could give you a couple different styles of drywall anchor so you could see what would work. Depending on how much they pulled out of the wall you might have to go straight to the kind that squeezes the drywall from both sides to hold.

This is why I try to fasten towel racks to the wall studs, rather than using drywall anchors. To fix it, you first fix the wall, then reattach the anchors, and put the bar back on. Not hard at all. I would recommend finding the wall studs next time. :-)

She'll forgive you if you replace her towel rack with the one in the picture below: ![](http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog%20graphics%202/1203193662_191.jpg)

However, everything is better with a few extra cheerleaders: ![](http://www.dallascowboys.com/cheerleaders/images/rotorooter_012208_400.jpg)
