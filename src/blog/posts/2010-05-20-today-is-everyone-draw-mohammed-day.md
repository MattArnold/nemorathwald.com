Why do I deny him the special non-drawing status accorded him by some of his followers? Because I'm not one of his followers. That's how it works. It's as simple as that. It's the same reason I don't rest on a special day of the week, because I am neither Christian nor Jewish. There is nothing attacking about it. Today is [Everybody Draw Mohammed Day](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-Draw-Mohammed-Day/121369914543425). On this day, the most effective drawing of Mohammed is an innocuous one. I don't say that to support Mohammed-- rather, because today should not be about attacking Islam. It's about showing that there is no just cause to take personal insult from a simple and respectful depiction. There is certainly no just cause for death threats. The more innocuous the drawing, the more ridiculous the over-reaction will look. This drawing is not an act of aggression. Threats will result, not in counter-threats, but in more drawings. To avoid even the slightest reasonable excuse for offense, I put a lot of work into historical accuracy. The ring, the lack of a mustache, garment colors, and so forth. Although I drew from many sources, [this page](http://www.reportret.info/gallery/muhammad1.html) has the most comprehensive collection of research on the topic. This is nothing like drawing your mom naked. This is not a drawing of him naked. He is not depicted doing any of the acts in life for which he has been criticized. He is doing nothing at all. Furthermore, your mother is not one of the most powerful and influential public figures of the last few centuries. Wikipedia describes Mohammed as "a diplomat, merchant, philosopher, orator, legislator, reformer, military general, and, according to Muslim belief, an agent of divine action." Perhaps your mother needs you to rise to her defense. Mohammed does not. He also died centuries ago. You and he are not on intimate terms. Influence over several million people is power. We must speak truth about power. The more powerful the public figure, the more we must resist placing him off-limits. In your drawing, treat Mohammed with the same polite respect with which you would treat a stranger. Our offense is in failing to treat him with deference. That is our right, and we will exercise it. If you dislike this drawing, I invite you to use a proportional response. Make a drawing. I don't care who it is of. It won't bother me at all.

_a diplomat, merchant, philosopher, orator, legislator, reformer, military general, and, according to Muslim belief, an agent of divine action_ Sound qualifications. I could aspire to, oh, five of those qualities and feel content in the accomplishment. Hint: I do not include the divine quality among them. :)
