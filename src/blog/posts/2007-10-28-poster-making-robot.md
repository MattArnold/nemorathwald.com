EPCOT Center had a robot arm that painted portraits, in the late eighties/early nineties. I bought a robot-painted portrait of me, but left it on the double-decker bus in World Showcase. Now I want to make something like [this poster-making robot made out of printer parts and an old Roomba](http://www.instructables.com/id/PosterBot%3a-Make-a-Marker-Writing-Robot-out-of-an-O/). What [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org) needs is an annual Hack Of Honor-- a live-and-in-person D.I.Y. Imagineering exhibit that makes conventions fun. We're not going to get Makers to pack up and bring their stuff without helping them. P.S. I won "Funniest Costume" at Blasted Bill's annual Halloween Bash last night for "Misinformed Time Traveler".

I like the title already...)

An Arthurian Crusader outfit and a ray gun. "I heard in the age of Bloggers, you guys battled trolls. So I came prepared for trolls. ... We're a little hazy on the details."

That's cool! One of the parties we went to had (sort of) a "murder" theme -- so I came as the victim, in a tux with a sword hilt sticking out of my chest.

I also support the HoH idea and will do what I can to actively support it/make it happen. P.S. my roommate is making a roomba mod to look like the cleaning robots in Farscape!
