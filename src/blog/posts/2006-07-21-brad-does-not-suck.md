Remember when Harvey Danger gave us ["Little By Little"](http://www.harveydanger.com/downloads/)? Here is another nice quality album whose creator has released it for free download on the internet: ["I Don't Know What I'm Doing," by Brad Sucks](http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/i_dont_know/). I would just like to direct the attention of the entire internet to the chorus of [this song (mp3 link).](http://www.bradsucks.net/music/albums/idkwid-128/09_-_Brad_Sucks_-_Overreacting.mp3)

If only everyone could stop over-reacting just by being reminded they were doing it....

I will have to see about downloading it when I get home. Your particularly noted song is a \*useful\* one. (:

Not bad. Not quite my style, but listenable. Brad Sucks doesn't suck at all. Thanks for the links!
