In my adult life, I have lacked health insurance almost as often as I have had it. Reading through the effects of last night's passing of insurance industry reform in [the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/22/AR2010032200410.html), I discovered that it expands Medicaid to cover those who make $29,327 a year (for a family of four). That's more money than I've ever made. That might mean, had the Republicans not defeated similar insurance reform in the Clinton era, I would have had health insurance all this time. I might be misinterpreting the phrase about a family of four-- it may be a stipulation of coverage. I don't know of any government incentives for the responsibility I have exercised with my reproductive system. It is its own reward. I have seen countless cases to convince me that reproductive irresponsibility carries with it more consequences than I would wish on anyone. So I'm not resentful. Of course, here's hoping that by 2014 when this Medicaid expansion goes into effect, I will be making enough not to need it. But it's nice to know.

From the article: "Childless adults would be covered for the first time, starting in 2014." And, in small part due to your inspiration, my own vasectomy is scheduled for mid April.

Good on you for becoming a safe partner. Oh, and by the way, enjoy your aphrodisiac.
