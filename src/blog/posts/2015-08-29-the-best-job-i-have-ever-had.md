I have now worked for one month at the best job I have ever had. I have never seen a software development environment so supportive of learning, and so well-disciplined in following responsible practices. Almost all day, every day, we sit with a colleague and code as a team. We write a test for a piece of functionality before we write the code to implement it. We use a continuous integration server which turns a screen very visibly red and alerts our chat channels whenever someone commits code that breaks the build. We call a stop to all work until it's fixed, so the project is always functional. We review new code with a pull request, then merge it directly into master-- and we delete every branch within two or three days of creating it. We take seriously the feedback generated at retrospective meetings, with specific action items and deadlines which we all follow up on. Instead of just adding more features, we keep a list of tasks to restructure the whole codebase, to make it easier and faster to add features-- and we are allocated official time to work on that. And best of all, we only work forty hours a week, which prevents the errors that would result from exhaustion. Does all this put us behind schedule? No. All of it makes our process faster in the long run.
