This week I illustrated another slide show, "Evolutionary Biology and Evolutionary Psychology".

Interesting images. However I continue to wonder if anybody has really given thought to what it is about a mind that sets it apart from a number-crunching computer. The mind assigns meaning to symbols, which I believe no computer will ever be able to do.

Nice! Although I'm pretty familiar with Eliezer's work, I find most of these slides to be quite enigmatic. This probably means that they'll work well in context, since they've avoided the dreaded Powerpoint disease. If it's not too much work, I wonder if you could add a few keywords to each slide, if only to satisfy my curiosity, and that of people like me?

OK, I've done that. However, I mostly used verbiage from the slides. He offered to explain at the start of the job, but I foolishly turned him down and dove right in to work. I wish I had taken him up on it, because now all I know is barely more than I have shared with you here.
