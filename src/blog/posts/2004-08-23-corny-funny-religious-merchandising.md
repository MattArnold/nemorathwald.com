![](http://www.shipoffools.com/Gadgets/Clocks/Pics/Repent.jpg) This is too hilariously precious for words. Beliefnet has a page catalogueing [religious kitsch.](http://www.beliefnet.com/story/116/story_11664_1.html) Here's [plush dolls](http://www.thegodsquad.com/cgi-local/shop.pl/SID=1093218087.18260/page=enter.htm) with names like Jesus Comes 2 Play, Moses Comes 2 Rock, and Buddha Comes 2 Play. Ship of Fools has a page of [Gadgets for God.](http://www.shipoffools.com/Gadgets/index.html) I want the "Job action figure with boils."

There is MOFO every Monday, without fail. It's at Denny's tonight, 8:00 p.m. I don't know why Bill didn't send the message. I just talked talked to him about it yesterday afternoon. I'd do it myself but I'm always concerned that I'd be double-posting.

Hilarious web-site. I loved the Lord of the Kings poster. I need to explore it more thoroughly. I'm stressed out at work again.

Okay the "No Preaching" sign is hilarious. I HAVE to get one! But instead of one that sticks to the wall, I'd want it on a hand held paddle like at an auction. =)
