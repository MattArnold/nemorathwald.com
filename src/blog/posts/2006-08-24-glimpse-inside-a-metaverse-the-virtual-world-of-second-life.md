I would love to somehow get Philip Rosedale and/or Cory Ondrejka to appear at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/)! This video has some great moments. -- talking about Second Life having a larger virtual land area and "real $$" economy than Monaco and rapidly overtaking Luxembourg -- showing off firework rockets that are piloted by astronaut mice -- a magic wand that reacts to the speaker's voice to produce objects based on words in his speech ("Santa": Santa's sleigh and reindeer drop out of the sky and collapse in a pile) -- 5,000,000 a month in real-world dollars paid by players to other players for their user-generated content; players are making money creating and selling about 180,000 distinct things at any given time

Google TechTalks March 1, 2006 Philip Rosedale and Cory Ondrejka ABSTRACT Linden Lab is the producer of Second Life, an online world with a growing population of subscribers (or "residents"); currently, the community has well over 140,000 residents from 91 countries. By providing residents with robust building and scripting tools, Linden Lab enables them to create a vast array of in-world objects, installations and programs. Since its early stages, Linden Lab has allowed its residents to retain full IP rights over their own creations, thereby insuring that their contributions to the community remain truly their own.

A friend of mine "makes" items in Second Life and sells them as a part time job. Apparently she makes ok money at it, too.

A friend of mine is a Linden, she is more or less the staffer who runs the community aspect. She was at some multi-hundred-person party last weekend for work. In other words, if you need an In to Linden for, say, a convention, I'm yer guy.

Yes! I want to talk to her about promoting Second Life at Penguicon! Here's another exciting idea. What if Penguicon provides streaming audio and video to an event taking place in the Second Life metaverse (what they call a physical/virtual crossover party) during Penguicon weekend?

I dropped her an email (San Fran being PST of course).
