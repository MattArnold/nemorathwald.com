Penguicon's Gaming Guest of Honor Jane McGonigal does a lot of work with museums, among other things. I recommend you read [this NPR story about it](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99244253) which aired on All Things Considered on January 15. Here are [the slides from her talk "Gaming the Future of Museums"](http://www.slideshare.net/avantgame/gaming-the-future-of-museums-a-lecture-by-jane-mcgonigal-presentation). Needless to say, when I hear her talk about 1 Satisfying work to do 2 The experience of being good at something 3 Time spent with people we like 4 The chance to be part of something bigger I immediately think of science fiction conventions. When she mentions all the pent-up knowledge waiting to be unleashed, I think specifically of Penguicon. I would love a storyline-based scavenger hunt, where what you are scavenger hunting are ways to get the most out of the weekend. I want to encourage attendees to get outside their comfort zone and explore the new fandoms, new knowledge, new friends, and new experiences that come together at Penguicon. The trick would be to define a set of challenges ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/SYFTpy-YfcI/AAAAAAAAGOU/IFiqCV10BUQ/s144/whydidntyoulistthose.jpeg) 1 of widely-varying difficulties. 2 using completely different styles: A social B physical C technological D creative E culinary ... with ribbons for the completion of challenges. The number of badge ribbons earned by all players as a whole would determine the end of the storyline. Let's say for instance the storyline could be about Orvan the Ox, Starfleet Tux, Beastie the BSD Demon, TRON, Jer\_ in a Cthulhu costume, Lojban, Steampunks, liquid nitrogen, and tesla coils. How hard would it be to come up with a quest storyline about that? I'm just thinking out loud here. Also among our assets: a bubble machine, remote control helicopter, dry-erase boards and markers, sandwich signs with just grids drawn on them, a Hoberman Sphere, two crowns, and costumes for the complete cast of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ including detachable velcro limbs.

I have no idea just how that would work, but it is an interesting enough idea that I'd like hear more and would not be averse to taking part in it. Would Orvan need another set of ribbons? I already have reason for three, two of which have been seen or at least attempted last year.

How could we get the "Secretary of Violence" involved in this?

In a "Choose your own adventure" manner? "Win Duel" = path 1, "Lose Duel" = path 2?

Well, in order for this to exist, someone would have to take charge of it. So that's a great way for the Secretary of Violence to get involved. But if you mean how could we get the Secretary of Violence involved in an imaginary version of it, just wish for it and it is so!
