_And also I'm really glad that I changed the weekend for Penguicon 2007 to May 1 through 3..._ Should that be 2009? We were just talking about this on Sunday, trying to intelligently discuss future plans.

Yes, it's a typo.

Good. I couldn't imagine how I'd failed to notice the historical shift in my own time-line. That eases my mind somewhat. In multi-universe theories, that would imply that I'm on the wrong time-line, with possible catastrophic results. So much simpler, all around, just to change the date of a future event instead.

I live about 4 miles south of the hotel that Penguicon has used for at least the past couple years. I've been involved with Notacon for the past 3 years and was the original organizer of Geeks with Guns at Penguicon 1.0. If you'd like to interact with many of the Michigan crew, outside of #mi2600 on the Notacon IRC server, you can find us at the Starbucks on South University in Ann Arbor, the first Friday evening of each month.
