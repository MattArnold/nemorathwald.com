![](http://craphound.com/images/indiocracyposter.jpg) [BoingBoing.net](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/08/idiocracy_mike_judge.html) reports that another of Mike Judge's smart comedy films is getting buried and not publicized, just like his classic film "Office Space". "Idiocracy" is about a future in which everyone is dumb because smart, educated people don't breed. It's as if the studio is trying to hide it and wreck its chances! That must be why I haven't been able to find a showing around here. But if I do, who wants to go?

Wanna come over tonight and play games with me and Bill and probably Anna?

That'd be delightful! I'd totally be up for it! .. if I wasn't meeting Ben for business tonight, and have made plans otherwise. :\\

I'd be interested if it isn't too far from me (which it most likely will be, since I live out in the boondocks).

I'd be interested in seeing this. The nearest theater seems to be in Chicago, and that's a bit too far to drive. Another rare film I'd like to check out, the documentary "Jesus Camp" (http://www.jesuscampthemovie.com), has a one day screening at the Maple in Bloomfield Hills on Oct 6. Can you bear to see it, Matt? It would be interesting to hear your perspective on the film.

Sounds something like "The Marching Morons". I forget who wrote it. Basically, a small group of smart people becoming more and more desperate, running civilization, while a much larger group of "morons" keeps getting larger. Pretty funny short story.

C.M. Kornbluth covered this topic in "The Marching Morons" a long time ago. Fundie religions cite it as a reason to ban contraceptive measures, which has seemed backwards to me. Aren't the smart people going to figure out ways to avoid that anyway...??? "If we don't have kids, the world will be left to the stupid ones who can't figure out how to stop having kids..." What's wrong with this picture? (In any case, I've produced my two. The world may someday forgive me...) In any case, it should show up in Ann Arbor eventually, so count me in.
