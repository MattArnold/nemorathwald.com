Agnostics, deists, atheists, pantheists, transcendentalists and other freethinkers are meeting for the next local [Universist meetup](http://universist.meetup.com/) at Barnes and Noble Booksellers on [Washtenaw Ave. in Ann Arbor](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&formtype=search&countryid=US&addtohistory=&country=US&address=3235+Washtenaw+Ave&city=Ann+Arbor&state=MI&zipcode=&historyid=&submit=Get+Map) at 8:00 p.m. Thursday, September 2. Those who are curious are invited to join us. Universism unites freethinkers by replacing the traditional concept of faith with reasoned credibility, inspiration in nature, and hope in progress.
