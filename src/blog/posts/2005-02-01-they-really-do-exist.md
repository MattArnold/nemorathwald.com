While I was searching the web for this image: ![](http://cns.utoronto.ca/~pkern/stuff/bsd-gifs/bsd-big.png) I found [this story of a UNIX developer wearing this on a polo shirt being confronted and kicked out by the God-fearing.](http://www.milk.com/true-stories/unix_for_the_masses.html) Some of my fellow liberal progressives recently denied on LJ that we have a problem with this kind of conservative in America. I've never lived in Texas, but I grew up with the people in this story. I can introduce you to some of them at my parents' church here in town. Decades ago I attended a private Christian grade school in Owosso, Michigan run by religious zealots who were stupid enough to get my classmates in trouble for drawing the solar system. They called the student body together and showed the drawing, asking if it was a sun god and challenging us to get right with the Lord. One lady confiscated a rubber stamp from a cereal box because if you twisted the triangle on top lid so that it was upside-down to the triangle on the bottom lid, you got what she thought was a pentagram. This was wrong on so many levels, that I just have to say "never mind."

It's so sad that backwards paranoid thinking still exists.....It makes you embarrassed about humanity.
