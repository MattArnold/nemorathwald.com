[What anti-abortion demonstrators said when asked what the punishment should be for women who got abortions if abortion became illegal.](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Uk6t_tdOkwo) I swear, the first person in the comment thread to mention that Bill Higgins and Brother Guy Consolmagno are "people of faith" and "best buds 4 evar with the G.O.D." will be sighed at with a withering glare.

Interesting, it seems the video has tapped into the soft squishy underbelly of American Christianity and also American Society. Most of the population doesn't think or read much about any issues, because they've been taught to formulate and hold opinions and stand their ground regardless of the argument presented to them. Abortion opinions are doubly baseless because the issue has been made a faith issue. So the issue is accepted unquestioningly as well. Fortunately it's a double edged sword. The same mechanism can cause a change in heart when overwhelming evidence and more importantly the public opinion starts to change. There seems to be a vast sea of lemmings. But I can almost guarantee that a real Christianist would have a strong male-chauvinistic opinion on the issue that involves either jail or death penalty for the woman, and ironically nothing for the man.

For reasons of workload I have recruited an associate to outsource my sighing and glaring needs. Please wait five to ten business days to receive your order.

This is actually not what I would've expected. I always think of right-to-lifers as being very bulldogish. I would've expected them to say the woman should be punished to the full extent of the law, period, end of sentence. The fact that only one of them even gave it any serious thought is pretty scary. And the last one was actually angered by the question. I guess she must've realized how ridiculous it was and her puny ape mind wouldn't let her admit it to herself. That was very fast work preventing her own cognitive dissonance at the expense of all involved, including herself. It's a sad, sad world.

The Pro-Lifers that I know would have answered that question handily. It's odd that they didn't come across anyone who has made an intellectual investment in their ideals.
