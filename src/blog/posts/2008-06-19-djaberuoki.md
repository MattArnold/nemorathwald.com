Â  asked for Jabberwocky translated into Lojban and back into English. This is done by inventing gibberish words within the Lojban phonotactic and grammar rules, just as Lewis Carroll did in the original. The problem with translating it back into English is that Jabberwocky is mostly not English to begin with. I'll do a partial retranslation. The Lojban translation of Jabberwocky is by xorxes.

#### djaberuoki

.i ca lo musne lo salstova cu curna carnu lo darnobe .i racydri fa lo burgova .i zdarnio radju grobe

Too many neologisms to bother with in this stanza. "mome-raths" is translated \[racydri\] (pronounced rah-shuh-dree), which means "fragile-sad things".

The tryer (heretofore referred to as "C") tries, attempts, or makes an effort to attain the state of any/some events of guessing, conjecturing or surmising.

.i ca lo cy zufpeinunmanci le djaberuoki fagri kanla lo talji ricfoi cu tolcanci je cluva fu le nanla

When C is considering-event-feeling-of-awe, there appears, irrupts, or materialises the Jabberwockeyish ocular sensory apparatus of the type that reacts with oxidizer to create combustion, from location: any/some talji type-of forest, where there coincides the young male person.
