[I've finished the artworks for the first five people to respond to the LJ Art Meme.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/152635.html) If anyone else wants one, you can ask, but I make no guarantees. And it helps if you make a request for something, even if it's vague. I'll do it if I like it. How many of you actually fulfilled your promise to make art for this meme? ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/space%20chess.jpg) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/portfolio/assorted_misc_forest_creatures.jpg) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/portfolio/dementedbunny.jpg) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/penguicon/linuxtan.png) ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/robedfighter.jpg)

Heh. I haven't fulfilled mine, but that's a "yet", not a "never".

Ditto to that.

Wait a second. I'm confused (although this happens quite frequently). I thought our part of the meme was to put whatever artwork you created on our lj. I think I missed something. What exactly do we need to do to fulfill our part of the meme?

Oh, and I like my custom artwork...but what _is_ it?

It is Linux-tan! With a KDE gear for a mohawk and a Gnome footprint emblazoned on his chest, this half penguin, half gnu is an anime-style personification of all things open source. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Linuxtan-orig.jpg

I just realized I totally forgot to add his mighty horns and beard of a gnu.

Yes, I was curious if that footprint was for gnome, but you can never tell. Very cool. Now that I know what it is, I like it even better!

Copy the text in the LJ entry, promising to do art for the first 5 who ask.

I did mine for the meme, but only had 3 requests. Two female and one male. Of course, I am not at all artistic, but I did beadwork for them. :)

I have been sorely tempted to do this, and then make the little coaster (i.e. pads to hold one's beverage) variants I have found on knitting and crocheting sites. Would that be welcome? I don't know. :-)

This reminds me of college. Good memories of it anyway. :) You are so very talented. Do me, too!!!

I like mine. It's the movement diagram for a Jester from Space Chess, right? (I had to look it up. I knew it was something like a Knight, but I didn't remember the exact name.) Very nice. Thanks, Matt. I haven't done any artwork for anyone because no one has asked me for any, not even (sob) my wife. Maybe they think this whole phenomenon is a Memetic Hazard. ![](http://www.aleph.se/andart/archives/images/warning4.png) Ron Hale-Evans rwhe@ludism.org
