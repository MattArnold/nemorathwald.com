It is time-consuming for me to draw women, and I am never satisfied. In the meantime, here are some more men. The [disclaimers](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/346896.html) still apply. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EHusjb4I/AAAAAAAAIFo/B48JQ5XJJTU/s400/Consuite1C1P.jpg)![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EIkASw4I/AAAAAAAAIFw/5DF0q6EW4MU/s144/Consuite2C1P.jpg)![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EI0U5DrI/AAAAAAAAIF4/75XLe2p6aFc/s144/Consuite3C1P.jpg)![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4Ee-CF9pI/AAAAAAAAIGA/VxVMJSGxbZw/s144/Consuite4C1P.jpg)![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EfMeCqfI/AAAAAAAAIGI/jQjrpcl6jw0/s144/Consuite5C1P.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EIMj_AzI/AAAAAAAAIFs/nGhDnB2bsnY/s144/Consuite1V1P.jpg)![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EIqvPqXI/AAAAAAAAIF0/GC9OehPXEbA/s144/Consuite2V1P.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EeyGUGJI/AAAAAAAAIF8/YZV6F9VCsfU/s144/Consuite3V1P.jpg)![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EfOfcREI/AAAAAAAAIGE/QPGREjU0er4/s144/Consuite4V1P.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH6nZUMinoI/AAAAAAAAIG0/piBz3QoqVOk/s144/Consuite5V1P.jpg)![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4EfSZN1QI/AAAAAAAAIGM/WQEPNR0KHPQ/s144/Consuite6V1P.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4FH4bU5DI/AAAAAAAAIGU/889hKNPB0rY/s144/Consuite7V1P.jpg) Every card in this stack is different. You never know what ConSuite is serving right now. But there's always free beer! Like ConSuite, this card is always a surprisingly good deal for the price. But you have to ask yourself whether it's worth taking that deal to give the next awesome deal to another player. Do they need treasure? Or victory points? And most importantly, did you see the high numbers already come out? Because some of the cards are Victory, I declare this a Victory Point stack and therefore there are 12 with at least 3 players. In a 2-player game, remove the 5-coin, and the 5/6/7 victory point cards. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4Fj62jKHI/AAAAAAAAIGc/Ak7DXRINnsM/s400/JoeCard.jpg) I hope you like math. This is the card of squares. Let's say you play one of these in one turn. You have $1 to spend. Two are $4 total, three are $9 total, four are $16 total. During playtesting we found out this really should be priced at $3, because it's so often worth less than a Silver. So I added victory points. Five of these are worth 25 total victory points at game end. If the other players are foolish enough to let you buy them all, you have a hundred and forty-four points. So they should buy just one which will not do much for them. As a victory card, there are 12 in the supply, but 8 in a 2-player game. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH4aCnYdPsI/AAAAAAAAIGs/vEo8dP23KSI/s400/SalCard.jpg) Soon you will see why Sal's "two bottles at a time" power is useful. (Other than buying up the Vineyards and Transmutes.) As soon as I get done drawing it. But after that, no more group portraits![

### For more Penguicon cards, continue to part three!

ROTFL. I need to play Dominion again. By the way, there's also a purple strip on the part of the toga coming down from the left shoulder. But I love it!

I love this a ton, but we need some women!
