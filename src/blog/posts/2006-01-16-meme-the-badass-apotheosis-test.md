**Hacking** 45% vivacity, 61% benevolence, 77% intellectualism

You are hacking! You grasp the austere, beautiful mathematical relationships behind things. Whatever you need to achieve in life, you translate it into the realm of the computer and perform the operations to achieve your ends. They don't call it code for nothing. On the other hand, your significant other is probably wondering where you are. May I suggest you give him or her a call during your next coffee break?

**The Zombie** 40% aliveness, 48% benevolence, 35% intellectualism

Graaah! Aaaargh! You are the Zombie! You once lived, spoke, and loved, but now you stalk the earth, terrifying the living. You exist only to devour brains. Sweet, delicious brains. You are unstoppable, a force of un-nature. You also smell bad.
