Yes, M.O.F.O. still meets between 8:00 and 10:30 PM every Monday at Denny's on Telegraph north of 696 and just south of 12 Mile. I won't be there this upcoming Monday because I'll be out of town driving home from [Philcon.](http://www.philcon.org/2005/) I haven't seen your livejournal name before. Do I know you from M.O.F.O.?
