I'm spending the day in Ann Arbor and will attend Tuesdays at Tios at 9PM. Call me if you want to hang out before then. 248-787-7436. I'm currently at the library. I'll be wandering around the vicinity of Liberty and Main, browsing Vault of Midnight and the chess store. I just found Liberty Street Robot Supply and Repair. It's a very fun store for all your robot-related swag! Their back room is the tutoring center of 826 Michigan, a free charitable tutoring and writing center for kids. Robot Supply and Repair is their storefront. How cool is that?

The Robot Supply and Repair is part of a larger community of tutoring centers. Learn about how it got started [in this awesome TED talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dave_eggers_makes_his_ted_prize_wish_once_upon_a_school.html). After you watch it you'll understand why I think they really should have opened it in Ypsilanti...
