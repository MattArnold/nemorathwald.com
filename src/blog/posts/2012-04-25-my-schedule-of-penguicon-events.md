Friday, 11:00pm: **Polyamory Primer** -- Polyamory is the concept and practice of being in multiple romantic relationships at the same time, with the knowledge and consent of all parties involved. This diverse panel of poly educators and enthusiasts will share their experiences, and more importantly, answer your questions about polyamory! (Brent Barker, Matt Arnold, Melissa Gilchrist, Sofia Maystrenko) Saturday, 11:00am: **Penguicon Board Meeting** -- The Penguicon Board is not the same thing as the Convention Committee. The Board meets four times a year to elect a Conchair, approve a total budget figure for next year's con, and take care of multi-year ongoing expenses. The public is always welcome to Board meetings! (Aaron Thul, Gini Judd, Jer\_, Mark Szlaga, Matt Arnold, Randy Bradakis, Steve Gutterman)

Saturday, noon: **ConCom 2013 Meeting** -- Open Concom Meeting for the brainstorming and organization of 2013. Not sure how to get involved in the convention? Let us show you how it's done! This is just the first step for opening up for next year. Come meet the Conchair for 2013 and tell her all of your brilliant ideas. All are welcome! (Cylithria Dubois, James Gamble, James Hice, Jer\_, Matt Arnold, Sarah "Sparrow" Slovik, Jon Wallace)

Saturday, 3:00pm: **Divination With Dominion Cards** -- Just for fun, we will pretend to perform cartomancy with Dominion cards. I have devised an intricate system for interpreting 10 randomly-selected cards to tell you the winning strategy for the next few days of your life. Saturday, 6:00pm: **Annual Dominion Tournament** -- In this million-selling “non-collectable card game”, players start with the same simple deck, and use their cards to buy cards into their collection from the middle of the table. They go through their deck repeatedly to use their new cards to buy even more lucrative cards. Whoever buys the expensive victory cards first, wins. Winner will be in the Champion Invitational this weekend, and win the deluxe set of base cards with fancy new graphics. You can sign up at Ops to make it easier on me, but if not, please just walk in! Saturday, 8:00pm: **Dominion Champion Invitational** -- Come watch the past Dominion tournament winners, including this weekend's winner, compete in one epic game! Saturday midnight: **Poly Relationship Transitions** -- In polyamorous relationships, a break-up can mean more than parting ways. We discuss what happens when a relationship changes - from primary to secondary, secondary to just friends, and more. What can we do to help smooth this transition? What can it look like? When could it happen? (Brent Barker, Edward L. Platt, Katie Danger, Matt Arnold)

I wish you would be there! I'm interested to talk to you about it and get your feedback. My interpretation will be based not on the name or illustration on the card, but on the instructions-- it is a complete re-theme of the game. Dominion is a game of playing cards in order to buy other cards into your collection. The key part of the cartomancy idea is that your deck represents your personality. By gaining cards, you grow out of pain and creature comforts to joy, enlightenment, and fulfillment, by forming good habits, and avoiding mood disorders. Will you self-medicate? Dodge responsibility? Engage in stoic self-denial? These and other tactics are yours to choose. However, it would be inappropriate for the other players to symbolize other people. Success in life is not based on defeating everyone. Therefore, the other players represent circumstances. The ten cards which are randomly available in any given game will represent one's environment.

your wish may become my command, sir. i will be in town that day. got a wedding to attend in the late afternoon - will have to see if i can make it fit. otherwise, we can perhaps work in an instant replay on sunday. in any case, your knack for cartomancy is badass, and i therefore have great faith in your ability to rock this.
