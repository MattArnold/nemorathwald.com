The realtor company in Lansing which gave me temp work during May has suffered a computer crash and needs me to come back for a couple of days to fix things. It will be Thursday and Friday of next week. I can't afford the gas for an additional round trip, and and moved out of Lansing, so I need a new couch on which to crash. The colleague who I trained as my replacement, Stacy, offered to let me crash at her place. I accepted, but if I can get somewhere else I'll decline, because suggests that Stacy might secretly (very secretly) be attracted to me and might misinterpret the situation as a return of interest. It doesn't look that way to me, but 's been proven correct on two previous occasions in my life that spending time with women is the same thing as leading them on. Does anyone in Lansing have a place for me to stay Thursday night? I have no allergies and I can sleep on the floor.

I could have a bit of floorspace, if you've got a sleeping bag or air mattress, but would prefer to be a second-to-last resort. Currently, I'm trying to rid the house of fleas. The floor in question is in a room that's been closed off, for the most part, but there's no guarantee it's flea-free.
