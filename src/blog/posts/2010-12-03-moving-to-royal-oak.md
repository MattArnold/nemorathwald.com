Throughout December I'll be moving to Royal Oak. MT, whom many of you know from Penguicon, has offered to rent me a room in her home for a very good price. It's near i3Detroit, so expect to see me around there more often! And she has made it clear that gaming parties in her house are not only allowed, but encouraged!

Good location. Right around the corner from us.

This sounds like a much better situation than the one with the old lady in Southfield. I live in Ferndale, so wave as you head to i3!

The wheels in my brain are turning round and round like a hamster wheel of dooooom. Maybe you could encourage me to take an occasional Dominion fix on the way home from work? ;)

Do you know what follows December?

January. New Year's Day. 2011. Is this a trick question? I like your icon.
