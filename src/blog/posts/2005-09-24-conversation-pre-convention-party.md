Tonight Bill and me and the rest of the [ConVersation](http://www.con-versation.com) concom are throwing a pre-convention party at [the hotel](http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DTWNTDT)! I'm excited! For those who don't know, [ConVersation](http://www.con-versation.com), is a "relaxacon." This means it's a small convention that is very inexpensive to attend because it doesn't have any of the guests of honor, panel discussions, dealers room or other things typical of an SF/F con. A relaxacon just has a great hospitality suite with complimentary food and drinks, a dance on Friday and another one Saturday, endless games, singing, hot tubbing, and parties in the hotel rooms. Relaxacons focus on friends, instead of a specific topic of interest. That's happening next July, and tonight we're renting the largest suite at the [Doubletree Hotel in Novi across from 12 Oaks Mall](http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DTWNTDT), to offer an advance taste. Pizza, pop and other foods will be provided. The hot tub in the suite will be open! The cost is: - either pre-register for the convention for $20, - or if not, then just put $5 in the donation jar to help cover expenses, - or if not, then just bring an item like cookies, chips, salad, beverages, or something like that to pass. - or if you don't have that, just attend!
