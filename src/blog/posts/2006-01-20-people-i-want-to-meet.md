Last night told [Eric Raymond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Raymond) how I was restraining myself from getting all flustered over [Vernor Vinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge). I mentioned to Eric that I had a short list of people who I wanted to meet or even befriend some day-- people of surpassing coolness who I admire, or who are my heroes, or who have inspired me, or who are on my wavelength to an uncanny degree, or various combinations of the above. He asked me to tell him the list. I didn't mention this to him, but he was one of the first to get on it, and he was the first to be successfully befriended. - [Cory Doctorow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow). I invited him to be a guest of honor at Penguicon, and we now know each other. His name has a check mark next to it on the list. - [Robin Lee Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitarianism). (). I met him in December. Check mark. - [Ford Vox](http://universist.org/fordvox.htm). He visited in December. Check mark. - [Eliezer Yudkowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky). - [Anders Sandberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Sandberg). - And, of course, [Greg Egan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan), although he lives in Australia and fans never meet Greg Egan, not even Australians. There is a timelike infinity loop surrounding his spatio-temporal locus. However, I will figure this out somehow. ([I went over all this yesterday.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/111955.html)) Needless to say, some of the most awesome people in the world would also include at least two local friends of surpassing coolness who I already know, and a couple of more who I've met but want to hang out with more. My life is a convention and they are all Guests Of Honor.

Matt, If you see ESR again this weekend, could you tell him to mail me back sometime about JPW? Thanks much. You'll be in contact with him more than I.

You didn't identify yourself, and I don't know what JPW is, so I don't know who to say to contact.

I'll take a stab and guess that that was my hubby. JPL would be Junk Pile Wars. ESR has expressed interest in being a celebrity judge this year. I have not the foggiest why he showed up as anon...
