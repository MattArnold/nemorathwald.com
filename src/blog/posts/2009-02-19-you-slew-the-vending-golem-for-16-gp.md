I somehow convinced the Ann Arbor Science Fiction Association to pay for a capsule toy vending machine for use by local fandom in southeast Michigan. Sometimes it is known as the Chaos Dispenser or the Vending Golem. Various groups use it to dispense things at conventions. We sometimes glue quarters into the machine's slot to reduce the price. Someday I hope we will come up with a permanent price-reduction solution. I currently have this machine open in front of me because at Capricon this weekend in Chicago, I will be vending static film window clings, t-shirts, and weekend passes to Michigan conventions: [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/), [ConFusion](http://stilyagi.org/cons/confusion.html), [U\*Con](http://www.ucon-gaming.org/), and [ConVocation](http://www.convocation.org/). So I am filling the machine's capsules with folded slips of paper. There is sixteen dollars worth of quarters in this vending machine, and apparently there has been for almost a year. The ones that we superglued into the slot were in the bin, having fallen out. Apparently people just went on using it to play the [Morton's List](http://www.mortonslist.com/) game (the last usage of the machine that I know of) after the superglue came loose. What do you know.

I have a feeling I've come in on the middle of the movie.

My pop fixes vending machine for a living. I don't know if he has any experience with the capsule kind. Offhand I don't think so. However I'll try to remember to ask. There has to be a way to alter the price on those things.

**I somehow convinced the Ann Arbor Science Fiction Association to pay for a capsule toy vending machine for use by local fandom in southeast Michigan.** Somehow? You asked, we thought it was cool, we gave you a Cool Stuff Grant. That's what Cool Stuff Grants are _for_... ;-)

So you don't remember the hypnotism. Good, it worked! Did I type that out loud?
