Sometimes a Penguicon worker goes several months at a time without responding to repeated contact with the convention, so much that we have no idea whether the job is getting anything done at all. When that happens, I either announce the person who is clamoring to do their job is now in that job, or I start publicly seeking a replacement. It has worked out well, because so far, they have a 100% rate of coming out of hiding as soon as this happens. It's uncanny.

Does that mean we have a science track head?

Oops! I was wrong. The rate has not been 100%. Thanks for reminding me, I need to get on assigning a replacement for Austin.
