The world's first nanotech CAD/CAE software is developed locally to [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org), runs on Linux, and is open source under the GPL. I am sitting back in my chair and staring at that sentence on the screen. Nanorex is a company based in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan that employs K. Eric Drexler, the Father of Molecular Nanotechnology, as Chief Technical Advisor. (Dr. Drexler telecommutes from his home in California.) Other advisors include names I recognize from frequent mentions on Christine Peterson's blog "Nanodot", such as Ralph Merkle, J. Storrs Hall, and Robert Freitas, Jr. Their product is [Nanoengineer-1](http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/mambo/), which uses a detailed and accurate model of the laws of physics to simulate atomic interactions in 3D. Engineers can design and test nanosystems in this software rather than use trial and error with the expensive and slow mechanosynthesis process of one real, physical molecule at a time. It is for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is open source under the GPL. Again. The world's first nanotech CAD/CAE software is developed locally to [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org), runs on Linux, and is open source under the GPL.

So, have you emailed them yet to invite them to the convention? (:

Yeah. I have no idea how to make use of this yet, but by God, I want to . . .
