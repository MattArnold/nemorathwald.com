![](http://www.allpeers.com/img/logo.png) I've been waiting for this a long time. [AllPeers](http://www.allpeers.com/) is a method of file transfer that lets you set up your own private network of peers with whom you can send and receive files of unlimited size. There's no more need to email a bulky file and wonder whether it's going to get through. Add friends and family members who also use AllPeers in the Firefox web browser, and decide what files you want them to be able to get from you. [Click here](http://www.allpeers.com/download.php) if you have Firefox, to go to the download page for this extension. Supposedly they're going to eventually open the source code. Also, supposedly this method is much faster than sending files through email or an instant message client, because it incorporates BitTorrent technology. Just one neat example of a little trick you can do with this, is instantly share a screen shot with a peer who's online... such as a tech support scenario. My username is MattArnold. Add me to your networks!

Thanks. I've been looking for something like this.

I signed up for the beta, and got a notice to go download my software, but I've just been too lazy to do so. I guess I should do this thing, eh? Maybe there should be an AllPeers leaflet at Penguicon, to facilitate picture sharing.

Hey, Matt: I was reading comments from users who've used it and a couple items caught my eye. One user mentioned that there's no way to shut down AllPeers once it's installed. Another user talked about AllPeers using your email addr. to send spam. Have you experienced either of these things, or any other downside effects?

Well it certainly can be shut down. When you exit Firefox, AllPeers and Firefox continue to run in the background, but can be turned off with a button in the system tray. As for spam, I have no way to know where my spam comes from. Can you provide links to where these reports were made with more details?
