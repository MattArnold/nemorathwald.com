[Ubuntero](http://ubuntero.com) is a social network for users of Ubuntu Linux. Who else has signed up? You should be able to search for "Matt Arnold" and friend me. I can ask my tech support questions there directly instead of here! My first question is going to be about this PGP key process they're suggesting that I do through Ubuntu's developer and bug site, Launchpad... their instructions don't seem to be working.
