Bill called me from the side of the road to say his car broke down on the way back from picking his girlfriend up from the airport. This is after my car overheated on Monday. I'm basically sharing the car of the ever-patient and giving . When she picks me up we've got to go to Ann Arbor to pick up the pocket programs.

I work odd hours (2-10 tomorrow, 9-5ish Friday), but if there's something I can do that involves a car, let me know.

2-10 PM tomorrow? Do you think you could take the pocket program from Clark Rodeffer in Ann Arbor at some point (his workplace is right next to Great Oaks cohousing where many Fen live), and drop it off with the hotel staff in Novi? My cell phone number is (248)-787-7436.

Yeah, I can do that. I'm printing out directions from Google Maps as we speak. Where exactly does Clark work (I've been to Great Oak before)? And am I to deliver the programs to specific staff?

I'll e-mail you with the directions. Have I told you how you totally rock? Well you do!

Thanks. :) I don't think I need directions, but can you tell me what time of the day would be best to go, if you know? I've never driven M-14 before and 275 only once, so I'd like to avoid morning rush hour. :)

Forgive me... but why would the pocket programs go to the hotel staff?

To hold on to for us so that they are there when we get there after the Thursday dinner. They may as well as long as they're doing so with the program book delivery. And also so that Rikhei doesn't have to drive all the way to Southfield to drop them off with me.
