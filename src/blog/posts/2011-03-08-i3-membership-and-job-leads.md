I sent the following message to the [i3Detroit](http://www.i3detroit.com/) mailing list today. It got the intended result!

> As many of you know, I am smack-dab in the epicenter of the target market for a hackerspace. I love i3Detroit-- hell, I've talked people into joining. I live practically down the street, and I'm there all the time. Of course I would join now if I could, but that would mean letting either my phone or my car insurance lapse. Currently I'm working part-time temp jobs while I finish going back to school. I graduate in Web Development in May. So, looking at my expenses, I have made it a short-term life goal to make at least $2000 a month, and any month in which I make that much, I will purchase one month of crafter/coder membership in i3Detroit. It occurred to me that you fine guys and gals could promote increased membership in your organization, by sending along job tips once in a while. Not spamming the list, of course! You could just send them to me off-list. I do: Publications and graphics in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Web development with HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, or a bit of Python. Animation in Flash. Motion capture animation in Blade and MotionBuilder. 3D modeling in Maya, Blender, Sculptris, and Wings3D. Thanks for any leads you might find! And as always, I encourage any i3Detroit member to put my skills to use free of charge in pursuit of your awesome maker projects. -Matt
