This happens to me about twice a year. You don't see it, because I keep most of it buttoned up, but convention program book contributors (or the program book designer, depending on which role I am not) drive me to my knees in an inchoate rage. Some are better, some are worse. This is one of the worse ones. I am patching together the latest (the latest what? "Documents" with scare quotes? Depositions at gunpoint?) mere _tissue_ of contradictions, as best I can, knowing that there is no time to untangle this web a day before it goes to print. Do not expect anything in this book to be true. In order to control that, I would have to be Conchair. Oh, wait! I tried that! It was the culmination of a multi-year quest to make _one_ program book that was simultaneously attractive and factual. Just _one_, ever. There I was, Conchair... at a point in my multi-year quest, as if at the lip of Mount Doom. So cheerful and polite, and yet firm in my vision for the program book! So helpful and attentive, yet keeping a non-micromanaging distance! Like an over-eager parent. I will trouble you no further with details of that tightrope walk, but to say the program book designer turned the finely-honed masterpiece of accuracy into an illegible mess because he is enamored of Open Source Software. Doubtless you heard the sound, from afar, as of [a thousand starving crows](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/71840). That was the sound of my spirit finally breaking. Pardon me while I dress in sackcloth and ashes and season my Wacom tablet with salt tears.

I'm grateful that you at least make the effort. And I admire your quest, since the most I ever do is bitch about program books from the bar.
