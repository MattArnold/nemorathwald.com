Does anyone in Ann Arbor have a couch I can sleep on Friday and/or Saturday night? [Protospiel](http://protospiel.org/) is this weekend and I'd rather not drive a full round trip every day.

Sure. GO is close by, I can see if the guest room in the Common House is available. Otherwise I have a spare bed in the (spidery) basement...

The guest room was available, I just penciled you in. Let me know if you don't need it.

Hey, thanks! I just got this. I got crash space at the hotel; thank you for the offer though! Sorry that I didn't respond earlier. I haven't been on the internet much.
