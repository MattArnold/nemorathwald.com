My podcasting presentation went as well as could be expected, given making the best of the unlucky conditions. My reliable circadian rythms normally knock me out at 1:30 to 2:30 AM at a convention. For the first time they failed me. I stumbled into a sleeping bag in the room adjacent to consuite at 4 AM. It is normally not difficult for me to sleep there, even though it's next to a room full of revelers. I was scheduled to work the 6 AM consuite shift, but Â did an extra hour and let me sleep in until after 7. I'm done working consuite now and I'm really starting to feel the sleep deprivation. My Shogi demo is at 11 AM. After that I think I will ask a friend for their room key and take a nap.
