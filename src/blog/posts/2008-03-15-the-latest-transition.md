R is apartment-shopping, is seeing other guys, and has encouraged me to see other women. As you know, this is not the first time this has happened in the thirteen years we've been together, on and off. It's just as amicable as the other times when she and I have divorced or stopped our relationship in various ways. It was neither sudden nor dramatic. I'll spare you further details, but feel absolutely free to ask me and I will answer fully and at great length. Currently my concerns are logistical. I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the near future about lodging-- I hope to be able to stay in this flat. I will also need to start using check-cashing storefront locations, having been turned down for my own credit union account.

"I will answer fully and at great length." I love that, it brings to mind this image of you just unfolding a chair and settling in... clearing your throat... and preparing to spend the day.. hehe :)

Yes, a fireside chat with a pipe and a glass of claret was what I had in mind. I'm not a smoker or drinker, but, as you say, the image. That reminds me, I need a velvet smoking jacket for con.

I, too, am looking for that for the lingerie party.. and silk pajamas. If you find a source, I'm interested.

Well, that certainly is the image I got, too. _An Evening With Mr. Arnold_

If I may ask: are you breaking up, or just seeing other people?

She's not interested in polyamory, and neither are the guys pursuing her. So, we do not consider ourselves together any more, except in the geographical sense that neither of us has found another place to live yet.

I have to admit I wondered how things were when, at Jessi's party, you guys didn't really seem to be spending time "together" onsite. I haven't been reading your journal regularly due to, well, needing space to work on complex emotional things, and also the tendency to fret about you when I do. It would be good to catch up at some point, if you're interested in doing that. All instincts to do a white knight rescue type thing to get you out of that apartment or help you keep it are being beaten down with a hammer somewhere internally by the part of me that knows a magentic pole should keep its distance but, \*shrugs a little helplessly\* If there's anything... ps credit unions are snobby things. check-cashing services are a waste of money. Is there a reason not to just get a checking or savings account at a big chain bank? Places like [Wamu do banking by mail](http://www.wamu.com/personal/account_features/bank_by_mail/default.asp) and are also an option.
