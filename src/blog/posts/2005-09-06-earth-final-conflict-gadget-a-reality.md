Remember the communicator the characters used on [Earth: Final Conflict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth:_Final_Conflict) called a "global"? [Its predecessor is here.](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000000056818/) The futuristic magic-marker-sized pocket videoconferencing gadget envisioned by the TV show expanded to about a six inch diagonal screen. Similarly, Philips' device employs a flexible "paper screen" that displays a crude four shades of greyscale and rolls up when the device is collapsed.
