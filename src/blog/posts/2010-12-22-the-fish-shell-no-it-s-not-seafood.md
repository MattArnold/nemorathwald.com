Fish stands for Friendly Interactive Shell. A "shell", in this context, is a type of computer application (more often found under Linux, although not completely unheard of on Windows and Mac) which gives you a command line with a complete language for performing most operations of your computer. Fish adds things like highlighting words in various colors to indicate whether you typed them correctly, before you run the command. It helps you end your quotes or parentheses. It autocompletes when you press the tab key. It's a lot like the new Google instant search results. Unfortunately Fish also introduced its own complexities just as counterintuitive and needless as that of previous shells. There are a lot more details on the pros and cons of Fish and other shells in [this article, "Fish Sucks, But Your Shell Sucks More"](http://markhansen.co.nz/fish-sucks/).
