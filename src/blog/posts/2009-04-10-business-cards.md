Anybody want some business cards? I would place the order and pick them up for you. The place in Hazel park where I buy Whuffie has a sale on black-and-white single-sided business cards, 250 for $10 or 500 for $14. Here is the card I made for Jen. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sd9HIdmfwzI/AAAAAAAAGbA/WMh6M6X-7Ss/s400/jenleadbetterbusinesscard.gif)

[Here](http://www.xkcd.com/114/) is the reference if you need it. But you don't, do you?

Hrm... maybe some for U-Con. :) Last time I made 30 and didn't use them all. :) This time we wouldn't put the convention date on the business card. :D

Just send me your text, and I will design it.
