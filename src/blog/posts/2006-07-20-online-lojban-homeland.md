Have you visited the land where [Lojban](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Learning_Lojban.htm) is spoken? It's called samxarmuj, meaning "computerized imaginary universe". It's a text-based world on the internet, where you can operate a character using commands in either English or Lojban: the online software is bilingual. Lojban is like the language of magic in samxarmuj-- speaking it can bring objects into existence and give them form and function. You don't even need a plane ticket. Just click http://teddyb.org/cgi-bin/moo\_ssh.html and use the password "moo" to log in as a guest until you have your own account. Commands are typed in the bottom-most part of the window. Guest accounts are limited to using English, so type the "register" command to get your own account. It's totally free. More information, including other ways to access samxarmuj, is available at http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+Lojban+MOO Intense labor on the part of many skilled programmers in our community has brought forth one of the most exciting venues in which to use Lojban that this language has ever had. Yesterday, the software left Beta. It is with bated breath that we launch this massively multiplayer system and declare it ready for the public. But now we need to massively populate it. We are currently summoning new mages of every skill level. Come build your own part of the land. Although you do not have to speak Lojban to adventure in the land as it forms out of the nothingness around us, all spells must be cast in correct Lojban. Whatever power hears our descriptions of samxarmuj, and turns them into reality, will respond to no other language. This land also welcome tourists with no skill in Lojban at all. Feel free to ask us any question about how to use the system. With enough interest, we may even be able to establish the Lojbanic equivalent of a Hogwarts academy for novice Lojban magicians! Who knows? Welcome to samxarmuj! Go native!
