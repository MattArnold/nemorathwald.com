I've been practicing using Photoshop and Illustrator to create images that correctly wrap around 3D objects. I'm wearing a t-shirt I made today. Here I'm in the Holodeck of the Sci-Fi Geeks Museum & Streaming Video Theater.

That's a great decoration, but too bad there's no place to transport to. I mean, there can't possibly be. Right?

Go to the window. Look up. Oh. My. Great. Green. Garfunkle.

I bought a uniform from a replicator on board the USS Defiant. But as you can see, step one in an android learning to be a real boy is to understand the bizarre human concept of "packaging." Here you see me wearing the box.

Heck yeah. The hair, silver paint, and gold contacts didn't come with the kit-- I added that myself.

Fun! Reminds me of the early Virtual Worlds that ran as Chat plug-in in my browser but now they've become really robust. I am not sure if I should be frightened or intrigued by the prospect of a virtual economy or not. I will be checking this out. I see [Lawrence Lessig](http://secondlife.blogs.com/photos/nwn/lessig.jpg) will be making an apppearance. Date: Wednesday, January 18, 2006 Time: 5:30PM - 7:30PM Pacific Standard/Second Life Time Place: Borrowdale/41/56 (the Pooley Auditorium) Sounds interesting. I've created an account and I have downloaded the software. Look forward to exploring this world.

_"I see Lawrence Lessig will be making an apppearance."_ Considering that Cory Doctorow has also made a personal appearance, I'm not surprised. I am delighted though. Sadly, they ought to make attendance to these appearances by ticket only. The only reason I say this is that Cory's online virtual signing was so well-attended that the region it took place in was crippled by absurd lag times and ran like treacle. _"Sounds interesting. I've created an account and I have downloaded the software. Look forward to exploring this world."_ Great! We'll have fun! But we can also be each other's accountability buddies to not overindulge and spend too much time away from First Life. :)

Accountability buddies? I like that. First life has always had priority in my book! I had to give up my night owl ways and learned firsthand with friends both Real Life and Online during those early MMORPG days... at least I think I learned. ;) I can only imagine the lag. Tickets are a wonderful idea... so when is the Second Life Penguicon pre-reg? :P
