_I'm still breathing, so it can't be that bad, he tells himself hopefully. Remember, if you break your neck during a botched parachute landing and then a mad conspiracy-theorist injects black market nanomachines into you, it's highly unlikely that anything worse can happen before sundown, he tells himself in a spirit of misplaced optimism._ [Appeals Court](http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/appeals_court.html) by Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross is the sequel to another of their collaborations, [Jury Service](http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/originals/originals_archive/stross-doctorow/). Their powers combined, these two stories form a novella titled "The Rapture of the Nerds," now available free online in its entirety. Remember how hilariously surreal Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was? I used to think science fiction humor had to be absurdist comedy like that. But hilariously surreal is the phrase I use to describe this team. Charlie Stross and Cory Doctorow constantly throw dizzying and head-swimming curveballs, while setting the wierdness in the hard science fiction near term, ripped from the headlines of genetic, nano and A.I. research with their own political twist. Frankly, some of you might not be ready to directly inject the neuropetrol of Stross & Doctorow. I dare you to read it! But read them in order. Start off with [Jury Service](http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/originals/originals_archive/stross-doctorow/) first.
