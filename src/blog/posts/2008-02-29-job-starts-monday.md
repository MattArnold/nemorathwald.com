My agency called with news about the company that was supposed to start me one month ago. The company has been promised that the computer I will use will arrive first thing Monday morning. They said that they want me to come in and get paid, and if the computer still fails to materialize, they'll have me sit next to someone else and watch. So there will be some income to keep me afloat for a while.
