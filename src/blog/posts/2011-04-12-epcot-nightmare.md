I just awoke from a nightmare in which I was in EPCOT's Future World section, but they had torn down:

1.  the Living Seas
2.  Test Track
3.  Mission: Space
4.  The Land
5.  the defunct Wonders of Life, and
6.  Innoventions

and replaced them with:

1.  a second pavilion about dinosaurs
2.  Minnie Mouse's house, and
3.  row on row of generic shopping kiosks

The timeshare and other kiosks were spread out in a tombstone pattern reminiscent of the ["Leave A Legacy" megaliths](http://www.makinmemoriesphotoblog.com/2010/05/25/leave-a-legacy/) at the front entrance. Basically it was an exaggerated version of what they actually did. I didn't take it well.
