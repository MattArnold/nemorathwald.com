I'm home now. I spent yesterday on Greyhound buses between Philadelphia and Detroit. When passengers asked if we had the much-vaunted outlets and Wifi, the driver said "no". Ours was just about the last trip on this route not to use the refurbished buses. All the same, I really like bus travel. While in Philadelphia, I commented that I wished I had known in advance so I could see a friend there. Andy made some comment about me knowing somebody in every city. During a layover, I texted to : "It will amuse you to learn I find myself unexpectedly in Cleveland!" If I had realized earlier, she may have stopped by the bus station for a chat. I only desire an increased income for one thing. Well, one thing other than the basic necessities of life's infrastructure (shelter, food, mobility, communication). Other things I don't need money for, because they are given to me as birthday/Christmas gifts (such as games). Then there are things that are given to me as hand-me-downs (clothes, computers). There is one thing for which I need a well-paying job: traveling to other people. That was given to me this week by someone else, but I've realized that doesn't happen often enough. That's what my career holds out to me-- the ability to travel. Not to travel to a place for the sake of that place. Places don't interest me much. I mean traveling to other people. There are so many.

_I only desire an increased income for one thing. Well, one thing other than the basic necessities of life's infrastructure (shelter, food, mobility, communication)._ I would add a few more things to that list. Eventually, most of us will find that the afflictions of age will diminish our capacity to generate income, and having savings put aside for that eventuality can help to reduce or eliminate the burden on our family/friends/societal safety net. Keeping reserves also helps smooth out some of the unexpected bumps in life. And of course, if one has enough to meet one's own needs, there are any number of worthy causes to which to direct the excess.

\*shrug\* Planning for my old age has always seemed a hopeless exercise in futility. It's difficult enough to get a job at all, much less a job that pays for more than groceries, rent, car insurance, and a phone bill. If a raise in pay provides me with nothing more than a pile of unused money, how am I to motivate myself? What you say is true, but given that, I may as well just give up the idea of travel.

I'd travel to see friends more, if I had more time! It's a good motivator. Sure, there's other stuff one could save for, and I try to be prudent, but it IS important to see friends, too. It's not like you're thinking "travel and blow thousands on hotel rooms".

I suppose this conversation is getting me ahead of myself. I've got to increase my income first. Then think about how to spend it. But yeah, travel is the only way in which I would increase my expenses. And I live incredibly frugally. That wouldn't change.

This is a bit off topic, but your post reminded me that I would like to invite you over soon for dinner and gaming. We don't see you nearly enough. :)

That would be fantastic! I have been doing most of my socializing in Royal Oak or wherever I could get a ride, in order to conserve gasoline. But if you invite me specifically, I'll show up! Sadly, tomorrow I move to Whitmore Lake, so it will be a greater distance. Thank you! :)
