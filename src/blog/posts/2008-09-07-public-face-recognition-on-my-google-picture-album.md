Google's Picasa web photo albums have a new face detection feature. It asks you whether you would like it to locate all faces in all your photos. If you say yes, it churns for a while and presents you with hundreds of thumbnail images of faces extracted from your photos. It asks you to confirm and correct the groupings that it thinks are the same person, which is extremely accurate. It asks you to assign names to them. Then it labels them all in your photos and lets you browse all the photos you have containing a given person. It has a feature to make these identifications public to viewers of your web album. The album owner can set each individual in the photos as public-viewable or private-viewable. So, I want you all to be able to choose. \[[Poll #1255342](http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=1255342)\]

I just don't even want to think about the eventual abuses this database will create. Ghu forbid one's doppelganger is out there, and labeled as a terrorist, or whatever next year's anathema will be.

There is zero question in my mind this will eventually be abused. There is also zero question that I have no control over it... too many people care too little for their friends to check like this (thank you for doing this, btw).. so I see no reason to stop you. The horse is already outside of the barn, and several miles down the road. That said, I strongly prefer only Jer or Jer\_... or at WORST jer plus my last name... but never my full first name.

I have to agree with Jer here. Please count me in for the same thing. No last names please.

You don't have any pictures of me. Do I need to send some to you so that you can put my name on them?

No, I have plenty, and you are already labeled in them. http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/view?uname=matt.mattarn&isOwner=false&subjectids=318#

Oh, huh, I didn't think of those. You can label me however you like, but the most useful label is likely to be "Tene".

It is good of you to ask. Now I have to winder about the several hundred other friends that won't have the courtesy to ask.
