[Found via Hacker News.](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/07/15/how-to-cure-deep-procrastination/) "...procrastination, in my experience, is not a character flaw, but instead evidence that you don’t have a believable plan for succeeding at what you’re trying to do."

> “Why are we going to expend so much precious energy?”, it asks. The more modern, abstract-reasoning, rational part of the student’s brain is quick to respond: “Because we need to expend this energy to pass the test which we need to earn our degree!” “What the hell is a ‘degree’ and why do we need one?”, the ancient brain counters. “Because that’s what you’re supposed to do,” the rational brain responds. And this is where the problem occurs.
