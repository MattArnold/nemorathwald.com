My parents have a pillow on which are embroidered the words, "Real love stories don't have endings." Maybe they do, maybe they don't. But they do have sequels. It looks like the sequel to the story of Rachel and I has come to an end. We were together for a total of ten years. It lasted a few years longer than we expected it to when we got divorced, but I was beginning to think that it might linger in a comfortably extended denouement for the rest of our lives. Even now, who knows what surprises the twenty-first century holds? Years or decades from now, the circumstances that have stood between us may change, and the volume might become a trilogy. But although she wants that even more than I do, she tends not to hold out hope for the distant future the way I do. Please send good thoughts her way. Right now, I am very concerned about where I am going to live.

Sorry to hear that. Re. where you are going to live - we have a one bedroom condo in Ann Arbor for rent. Email me if you want more info.

\*sends her good thoughts\* \*sends you good thoughts\* For whatever did happen I'm sorry, but for whatever good is coming from it, I am happy for you, and her. And as you said, it doesn't really mean the end of the story is near. My apartment complex out here in Rochester Hills is fairly cheap and if you have a roommate it's even better. It's pretty "central" to most of the events in Mi, though you'll have a wee bit of a drive for the things in AA and the like.

I'm sorry things didn't work out and that they're uncomfortable right now. I wish I could offer the right words, but I don't have them. I can simply say that I'm glad you have many friends. If you're looking for a spot to live and don't find my house out of the way, I just had a roommate move out. Come to think of it, you've seen the room. It's available for $400 a month + deposit and you can move in... Well, hell, tonight if you'd like. Good luck, Matt. Don't forget that you can lean on your friends. That's what we're here for.

Thanks! I've sent an e-mail to the two addresses I have for you, one which I am not sure is you, the other which I don't know if you read any more. Here's hoping!

Sorry to hear that your orbits are approaching their apogee. Since you ended on a practical note, I shall continue. Will your Thursday evening meeting be affected?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2006 3:36 PM

No, it won't be affected! Same place and time. Please be there!

I'm sorry. I hope things work out for the best.

I'm always sorry to see relationships end. Part of me doesn't think they ever should and will always work out (fairy tale complex or hopless romantic - take your pick), even though I know in real life it's not like that at all. So hugs and best wishes to both of you. Sorry I can't help you with the housing situation, but sounds like you have several leads.

I'm sorry to hear this, and I hope it works out for the best for both of you. You'll both be in my thoughts. I don't have any recommendations on living arrangements, but I can help you move.

Luck with that! ;D

Oh, Matt.. I'm so sorry. The end of a relationship is always difficult, and a long-term one is that much more so. I'm sending good thoughts both her way and yours that you find peace. And a \*hug\* for good measure. :)

**[ext_302099](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_302099)** on Feb. 21, 2006 4:57 PM

Sorry to hear that. At least it sounds like an amicable split.

Or if you'd like other options - have I your permission to send out a room-hunting net within my extended circles? If so, what are you looking for?

**[ext_344389](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389)** on Feb. 21, 2006 7:47 PM

Good luck and good things to both of you. As hard as it is for me to believe this right now, I still think everything that happens does so because it's the path we chose long before we got here.

**[ext_88358](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_88358)** on Feb. 21, 2006 7:54 PM

\*hugs\* At a loss for words here.

If you'd prefer to be closer to Ann Arbor, I have a friend who I believe is still looking for a roommate. It's an awesome condo, I think. I believe it's about $550 a month. Let me know if you're interested.

Wow, sorry to hear about that. Keep on keeping on.
