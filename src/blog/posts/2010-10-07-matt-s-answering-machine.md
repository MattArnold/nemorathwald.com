Hi Everyone, I'm the mysterious J (or perhaps not so mysterious if you know Matt in real life), and I'm here posting at his behest. The reason, and I quote:

> _I recuse myself from the Internet today because I fear my judgment may be impaired on account of seething rage._

In other words, he won't be getting back to anyone today. Those of you with petty ideologies, please take them out for a short walk and a potty break while he spends some time doing laundry and taking a much-needed breather. Everyone else, he promises he won't be gone long. ;) Sincerely Yours, J

Now I'm curious what set him off...

You're not the only one. I'm hoping for a good friends-locked rant.
