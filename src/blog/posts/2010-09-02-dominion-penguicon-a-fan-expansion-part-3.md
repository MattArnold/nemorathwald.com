That group portrait I mentioned will be delayed until my new tablet gets here. The problem with tablets is that the cords tend to get bent out of shape and stop working. The new one is cordless, so I hope it will last a good long time. Standard issue of [disclaimers](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/346896.html), Rio Grande, etc. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TH7P9-C-b_I/AAAAAAAAIHM/3nMOCR4jGPk/s400/TracyCard.jpg) Tracy is a recruiter. Recruiting a free Action card onto your team is a big deal. If you've got the right people available to recruit, we're talking game-changing. Such a big deal in fact, that to destroy another player's ability to do that would be worth losing an Attack card. Trashing other players' Attack cards is just as big a deal. However, nothing on this card says the Attack won't get resolved first. Because it will. How do you reduce the luck factor in stopping another player from cleaning up the board with this card? Buy a lot of Attacks. How do you reduce the luck factor if you're playing a strategy based on this card? Besides the obvious "don't buy or gain any Attacks," if there is a card available that lets you trash Curses, have Tracy work closely with that card. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TIQBP0qkuJI/AAAAAAAAIII/qu15YLSAhA8/s400/AnneABCard.jpg) This card has a lot of text. Just like Anne's bookshelves. Another card for which every copy in the stack is different. There are enough letter combinations for a five-player game to start with three each: AB AC AD AE AF BC BD BE BF CD CE CF DE DF EF A few things to keep in mind: - Your first player advantage isn't really. When you play this, everyone sees the letters you have, so they're going to guess those. - The cards go back to the supply before you get the reward. - It says "Each player", not "Each player except you", so you can name your own cards, return them (other than the one in play), and there you go. - In Dominion, attacks happen clockwise starting with the current player, when it matters. This is a case in which it matters, because you can only buy the top card of any given stack. When someone does so, note the letters. - Do not overlook the usefulness of this card in gaining information. The last player with a copy of this card would get an overwhelming reward every time. Pretty soon you'll all start buying one or two Annes just to keep her workload spread too thin for that to happen. Think how useful a [Secret Chamber](http://dominiondeck.com/cards/secret-chamber) would be with this card.[

### For more Penguicon cards, continue to part four!

I'd send Anne off on a nice Island holiday

\*grin\* With totally understandable narcissism, I'm intrigued by the Tracy card. I think I'm going to have to make a mockup and see how the card interactions work. Particularly interesting with either good hand clenaing, or limited curse distribution. Looking forward to the rest of this.
