There's a lot for me to say about Penguicon over the next few days. Three of my events were very successful and popular and are requested for next year by popular acclaim: the [Pantropia game on a Hoberman sphere](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/39696.html), the [Lojban class](http://www.lojban.org/) and the [coffee ritual](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/27175.html). Also I'm pleased to have received plenty of appreciation for the program book and wall schedule. I was stressed out about the info kiosks on Friday. They worked and worked and worked, and then got to the hotel and stopped working. The invaluable webmaster Ron Blanchett worked tirelessly on it for hours instead of all the fun things he could have been doing. We got them mostly working most of the time. That's a step in the right direction! Last year I was dis-satisfied with the computer room and dedicated myself to fulfilling its potential. I definitely failed at this. I don't know enough tech geeks personally. I plastered prominent requests on the website and mailers for months about bringing computers to the convention and still, people hardly did so. I currently have an entire spindle of CDs that went un-burned, and an entire box of labels for hardware check-in that mostly went unprinted. Thanks to the three people who volunteered to be computer room attendants, including . I was wondering if no one cared and I should give up, until Charles Ulrich volunteered the efforts of Lansing LUG and restored my hopes. How fondly I remember my first introduction to Linux at 2.0, having not seen it at all during 1.0. I vividly recall all the things Rich Clark showed me that Linux could do. He inspired me for the potential of this feature of Penguicon. This experience must happen to other newbies in the computer room. If only I were a tech geek who could do that myself. More about the con report later.
