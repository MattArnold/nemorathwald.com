[_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom,_](http://www.craphound.com/down/) a science fiction novel by Penguicon's Guest of Honor Cory Doctorow, is a finalist for [the 2004 Nebula Award for Best Novel!](http://www.sfwa.org/news/nebula_ballot04.htm) _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_ concerns a reputation economy in a future of immortality and no physical need, where ad-hocracies (very similar to SF convention committees) are running Walt Disney World as a hobby. Distributed for free under the Creative Commons License, which is to art and literature what the Open Source License is to software, this novel can be downloaded in electronic form from [Cory Doctorow's website](http://www.craphound.com/down/). Previous awards and nominations for Cory Doctorow include winning the 2004 Sunburst Award for Best Canadian Science Fiction Book, a nomination for the 2003 Locus Award in the category of Novella, and the 2000 John W Campbell Award for Best New Writer. He was also a 2003 Nebula nominee. Congratulations, Cory! Last year, Penguicon's literary guest of honor Neil Gaiman won the Best Novella Nebula for Coraline while at Penguicon. (Did someone win an award at the first Penguicon? I can't remember.) Let's hope to make this a tradition this year!
