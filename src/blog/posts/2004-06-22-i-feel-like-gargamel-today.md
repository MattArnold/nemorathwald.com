Finally, finally, finally there's [an image of _Navia Dratp_](http://www.gamus.com/itemdetail.asp?itemnum=GBAN14141) on the web somewhere. The guys and gals at [Chessvariants.com](http://www.chessvariants.com) had to take my word for it that the darn thing even exists. In honor of this I intend to nickname the game Snuffelupagus. According to the [latest gossip on the web](http://www.animex.com/resources/news/index.cfm?fa=detail&newsid=2740) that Google has gotten around to spidering, the debut is pushed back from June to August. Damn it, it was so close!

OK, now Bandai has put up a website, www.naviadratp.com although so far it only says "Coming Soon, Street Date August 14." They wisely got two URLs for those who mis-spell it. ![](http://westfield2.com/wow/art/large/gm028.jpg)
