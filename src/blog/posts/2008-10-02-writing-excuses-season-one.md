Announcing the newest podcast available on archive CD through [PodDisc.com](http://poddisc.com), [Writing Excuses](http://writingexcuses.com)! Here is the shopping cart site for their [Season One](http://poddisc.myshopify.com/products/writing-excuses-season-1). Brandon Sanderson, Dan Wells, and Howard Tayler present a tightly-paced podcast of advice for writers. This CD is the first complete season of MP3 episodes, each one “fifteen minutes long, because you’re in a hurry, and we’re not that smart.” It includes bonus episodes, outtakes, a full novel, sample chapters, essays, and desktop wallpapers. I've already sold forty copies in the first day and a half. SWEET LARD AND HEAVENLY BUTTER. And the news hasn't even hit Howard's Schlockmercenary blog yet. I just got another one while I was writing this; but that one will have to wait. It's time for me to go to the post office!
