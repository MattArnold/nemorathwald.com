Two requests for you. First, in order to keep my head above water I need to supplement my current weekly twenty to thirty hours of work. Please let me know if you can get my foot in the door at a job with flexible hours, preferably in the evenings and weekends. For the past couple of weeks, I have no longer been in the Project Management aspect of my position. They really needed someone who could hit the ground running. Without training or experience in the nature of hourly service companies, and no knowledge of our products and services, I had a learning curve. Even had that not been the case, it was impractical to stay in the loop while telecommuting. We currently have no website clients for me to work on, so my job consists of cold calling in Sales. That brings me to the second request: sales leads. Please put me in touch with companies who might need Voice Over Internet phone systems, or web hosting and administration. I need to start bringing value to my employer immediately.

What kind of work are you willing to do part time? Is unskilled labor acceptable to you? Also what area do you live in?

Unskilled labor is completely acceptable to me. I'll accept any flexible-time employment provided it is legal and ethical. I live in Redford near Inkster, Five Mile Road and Six Mile Road.

I would then recommend the Trader Joe's in Farmington Hills if they're hiring. Very flexible scheduling, (from 4am to midnight every day, store hours are 9-9 and the rest is stocking time, you give them the hours you're available and they schedule you within them). Usually between 9-10 / hr to start with a review and raise every 3 months, benefits and a laid-back work environment with generally very intelligent people. It doesn't hurt to be a food snob. If you'd like, ask for Charles and tell him I told you about the place and that you're more punctual than I am. :)

No problem, hope it works out or if not, that something equivalent or better in coolness comes along!
