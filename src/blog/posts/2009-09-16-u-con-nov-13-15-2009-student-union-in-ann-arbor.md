This is a very exciting year for U-Con. We have so many new things, and so much of what you love will be back. What's new? We are honored to have Sid Meier of Civilization fame as our guest. He'll speak at several seminars on his games and career. We are also launching a new video game track. Our partners at Wolverine Soft (http://wolverinesoft.com) will bring console games. We have a schedule posted online for video games but it is subject to change. Additionally, we're thrilled to host the GenCon games library! _Wheeled shelving units bearing **seven hundred and seventy-five** games._ Add that to Mayfair's Origins Awards traveling road show of prize-nominated games, and I am reminded of the saying "a million here and a million there and pretty soon you're talking about real money". Except substitute "hundred" for "million", and "games" for "money". What's the same? We have many GMs back who bring a wide variety of events. We have the Smithee Awards, Paint and Take, the auction, and of course the exhibitors hall. This U-Con has more events at the open of preregistration than we've ever had. However, we'll continue to accept events until we have no space left. We're also accepting volunteers, so contact us if you are interested. Especially volunteers to help me out with a shift in Ops/Registration.

Oh, that's a bummer.
