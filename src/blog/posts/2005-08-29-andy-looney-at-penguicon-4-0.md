![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/DrinkingCocoa.jpg)Once again Penguicon is going to have a guest of honor who I am personally excited to meet. The genius game designer, activist, and former NASA programmer Andy Looney has accepted our invitation to be Gaming Guest of Honor for Penguicon 4.0! I first learned about Andy while researching game design several years ago. He has a lot in common with me, such as his interest in World Fairs and his desire to be cryogenically frozen and awakened in the future. Although I don't share [his love for Tiki culture](http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Andy/Leftovers/tikis.html) (mid-century "Polynesian Pop") it is nonetheless very cool, and it eventually resulted in him noticing that it doesn't represent the real Polynesia and never really existed anywhere in the real world. That reminds me a lot of Lojban. I consider Lojban to be to language what the Icehouse pieces are to games.\* This means at least two action items for me not immediately connected to my role in Penguicon communications: #1 I need to get the download of my custom Gnostica deck working again on my website. #2 I need to alter the slide show for my Lojban presentation to show [the jbopre at LogFest playing Zendo.](http://wiw.org/~jkominek/logfest/2002/Logfest%202002%20018.jpg) At every past Penguicon the fan promoters of Looney Labs, or "Mad Lab Rabbits" as we are called (some of whom are even on the Penguicon concom), have been seen in the gaming room teaching the ingenious game designs of this colorful little hippie game company. Their Icehouse pyramids and card games Fluxx and Chrononauts were invented by Andy. "Are You A Werewolf?", published by Looney Labs, is always a popular Penguicon event. Kristin and Alison will accompany Andy as Nifty Guests, so Looney Labs will be out in force at Penguicon 2006! ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/GTS02Booth.jpg)![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Section.Intro.gif) \*P.S. My new mural on the left edge of [my Lojban page](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Learning_Lojban.htm) is very Looneyish, don't you think?
