![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000c813c) To Be Continued I've always had a sentimental soft spot for happiness interrupted by sadness. For me, sadness is sadder when contrasted with happiness. The early animated "The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" had a scene that stands out to me decades later for this reason. Animals are having a party in the woods to celebrate the end of winter, and the White Witch appears and turns them to stone. As a child, that deeply disturbed and upset me. Because they were having fun. Other memories from the distant past. Words cannot express what it felt like to be in the Walt Disney World parks, my favorite place ever, on one of the two or three precious days in the year that I could spend there, waiting for my parents and siblings in a meeting place that got confused. That precious, rare time, unparalleled in intensity, and I was standing in the middle of it and _missing it_. I get a little misty-eyed looking at the second panel. Oh, I know, that has all the artistic subtlety of hitting the emotions with a cheap bludgeon. But that's OK, somehow it doesn't feel that way. I must be doing something right.
