interesting about bad drawing being due to the laziness of brains and the recognizable qualities of symbolism. reflective of your comment that evolution only looks for 'good enough' rather than 'superlative'. all a symbol has to do is get a point across. reflexive oversimplification seems to be a regrettable side effect of prioritizing efficiency. this, too: "Concepts can disadvantage us (and benefit us) in some ways because they're imprecise, but they're traps because they're commitments." relatedly, the way the fu is taught does something similar to the technique described, with the showing of basic moves and simultaneous denial of overall meaning, on account of the body can learn it better without a definitive filter. same idea, near as i can figure. this bit says it well: "With enough obfuscation, you should get to a place where you can see things as they truly are, and when you draw the lines and fill in the dark and light places as you see them with your unbiased eye, you'll likely produce something that looks a heck of a lot more like reality." and may also have something to do with why fiction can so often bring a deeper statement to the table than "factual"-type writings are able to do. this part is good, too: "Of course the ultimate goal is to be able to see things as they are without needing to obfuscate." which i agree with...and also, that it sure does make a difference to have the opportunity to get all the way to the right level of perception to make that work. you know, so it actually \*can\* work when one does get there.
