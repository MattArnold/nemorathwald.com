I've been waiting, but somebody has to be the first to say it. In place of Buffy this year, "[Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog](http://drhorrible.com/)" live re-enactment at Penguicon. I volunteer!

That would be a reason to go to Penguicon (if I'm not going somewhere else that weekend).

You're the con chair, sometimes you need to stop delegating. ;)

oh, now there's a mental image that's gonna linger......Matt Arnold as Dr Horrible, with Jer playing Captain Hammer..... Thanks for the early morning giggle.

I have been known to do some singing... a bit

Haha, that does amuse me, generally speaking... is it time to start memorizing songs?

It's a musical, and it's geeky. It's like, geekusical! Now if I can just get the video to work.

Sounds like a good idea, do you see yourself as Dr. Horrible or Captain Hammer?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Aug. 4, 2008 6:56 PM

Jen and Rachel think I should perform Captain Hammer. But in the way you phrased the question? In _life_? Dr. Horrible.

---

**[ext_46539](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_46539)** on Aug. 4, 2008 7:25 PM

I think most male fans see themselves more as Dr. Horrible than Captain Hammer.
