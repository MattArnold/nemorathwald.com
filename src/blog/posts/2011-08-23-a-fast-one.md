A recruiter just called to offer me a long-term contract job, based on keywords in my resume. Then she retracted the offer halfway through the phone call when she read my resume. Fortunately she was happy to answer my questions and give me advice on how to change my resume. She even gave me a job lead to follow up on. It's an internship, in Royal Oak.

Wow, that was pretty crummy of her.

Actually, not so crummy. She may have given good advice, and also, it was her fault she didn't read it, not his. Assuming she admitted this. Do you think there were aspects of your resume she didn't like, or that it just wasn't a good match? I assume you send your resume around to your friends to critique, especially the friends who don't hesitate to be assholes. That can be the BEST advice ever. I know when I'm hiring that errors in resumes make me just totally crazy. Seeing a nice one is like a breath of fresh air. Sort of sucks to hear about an internship.. where you just left :(

She thought my whole career was in web development, not just the past year. So, she advised that I split the resume into sections that reflect that. As for the place in Royal Oak, there are developments today. I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch. Watch for news soon. :)
