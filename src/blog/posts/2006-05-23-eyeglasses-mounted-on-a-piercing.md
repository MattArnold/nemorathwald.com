That's actually very cool and techno-geek chic... but more something I'd like to see on a movie character and not walking around in real life.

I keep thinking -- what if it gets bumped?

I think it'd be better on strong magnets, like some clip-on sunglasses use. Then it's more easily removeable, and it would have a "quick release" if they get hit! Neat concept though.

Now THAT would be the way to do it...

Have you never had two magnets on either side of an ear? OMG THE PAIN! I'd much rather have a piercing.

How about, a piercing to which the glasses are affixed by way of magnets?

Perhaps. In any case, it's not something I'll likely do. :)

Darn, I have to wait till later to look at it. Work is blocking the site.

I've seen that before, and seriously considered it. But then I'm lazy and would fall asleep with them on and wake up to find a really bad sort of bloody nose.
