For me, this will be the best Penguicon ever, and I'm in control of making it so. But instead of being as happy as I could have been, I have been fretting about what could go wrong! This has now come to a stop. I have just invented a new catchphrase. 'AWESOME' MINUS 'SOME' IS STILL 'AWE'. Take that home. Chew it. We're meeting soon with a reporter from The Detroit Free Press at the hotel where, one month from now, 800 of us will "synchronize knowledge bases", as we euphemistically like to call it these days. Heh heh. We are probably to be photographed in front of [The Death Star sculpture](http://www1.hilton.com/ts/en_US/hotels/content/DETNHHF/media/images/photo_gallery/DETNHHF_Hilton_Detroit_Troy_gallery_accom_exterior_large.jpg). Nothing sustains my spirits like keeping my eyes on the prize. In one month, while those 800 are getting their geek on in myriad forms, what will be the personal reward of my labors? [Charlie Stross](http://www.accelerando.org/), [Christine Peterson](http://www.foresight.org/about/Peterson.html), [Karl Schroeder](http://www.karlschroeder.com), [Ron Hale Evans](http://ron.ludism.org/), [Jonathon "Sullydog" Sullivan](http://www.escapepod.org/2005/05/12/ep001-imperial-by-jonathon-sullivan/). I personally beckoned them. On April 20 through 22, 2007, they will be in the same building. They will talk to each other. The world as I know it might change irrevocably. :) At the end of the weekend, Landley and Eric Raymond will present their "[World Domination 201](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/world-domination/world-domination-201.html)" strategy paper concerning Microsoft, Apple and Linux. And then the world as _we all_ have known it might change irrevocably over the course of 2008.

That is a most excellent catchphrase.

Woot. Like that. And I \*love\* the icon. (:

Don't forget the chaos dispenser! I think you underestimate the degree of fun that thing is going to add to this convention. It will not be soon forgotten, I predict. We're gonna have to remember to bring our camera this year, cuz if somebody doesn't post pictures of this stuff, we definitely will.

Well yes, there are all _my own_ projects, but I never feared for their status to begin with. Thanks, I'm excited about it too! :)

I know what it's like to be scheduling your favorite authors for a convention. Hope it goes well.
