I'm entitled to another 52.5 hours of vacation time beyond the days I've already taken. I had no idea I get that much, so I've been zealously hoarding it _all year_ in order to not come up short. It's not reusable. What am I going to do with it in two months? Today I'm going to [Youmacon.](http://www.youmacon.com/) I wonder if I can take the rest of the day off...

I had some forced vacation taking; had a nice road trip. Up throught the UP, then left to MN and SD and even a little Wyoming for Devil's Tower. Then home again. Took ~2 weeks. You've almost got that; you could combine with the Turkey-Day Holiday and make a big go of it...? --Bill

I used up all my time already including my sick days. You could take off an hour here a half a day there or even a Friday or Monday here and there. It might go quicker than you think. Hope you have fun at the anime con. :-)

Use 'em! That's my motto anyway. You can always take mental health days, stay home and organize your life, get things done that you otherwise wouldn't have time for. I say that's a pretty good use of vacation time, personally, especially if you can't take an ACTUAL vacation anyway.

Long weekends, extend Thanksgiving weekend. Do you get the week between xmas and new years off already? if not there's a chunk of time there. Take some time off for some of your art projects. If you get really bored, I can give you some projects around the house. :-)

_"Take some time off for some of your art projects."_ Why didn't I think of this immediately? This is exactly what I should do.

Make sure you get them scheduled asap! If your work is like mine, it's so damn hard to get away, there are always a bunch of people who need to use or lose their vacation before year end, more than can be spared.
