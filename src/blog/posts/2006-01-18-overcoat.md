I miss my Navy P-coat. My current coat is awkwardly puffy, and not long enough to protect me from the seat of my car on a morning like this one. It's also tiresomely pedestrian, and makes me feel like a thoughtless ragamuffin, which [just isn't me.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/2004/04/23/) I wish to purchase and wear an overcoat. Nothing ridiculously expensive; I'm thinking of the $50 to $150 range. Also, I don't want one made of fancy leather that needs to be protected from the elements. Any recommendations on coats or stores? , you've got good taste, what do you think?

I highly suggest thrift and resale shops. Salvation Army type. I've worn a trench coat for many many years, and have always found very good quality ones there. Every five years or so I buy another. I think the last one I picked up was the most expensive: $20 for a London Fog coat with a full fur liner.

Excellent- thanks! I know of two suche shoppes\* nearby. I currently think I will look for something like [this one.](http://www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Section_Id=12231&pcount=&pn=1&Product_Id=414100&sku1=o_s1_66976550) \* deliberately archaic mis-spelling

The trenchcoat I wore today to the IRS interview cost me a whole $8.50 at Value World many years ago. :)

You might try Burlington Coat Factory. I got my long black wool coat there (admittedly several year ago) for only $100.

There's the London Fog outlet out around exit 132 on I-96 out around Fowlerville. And there's the value world just down the street. The downside with VW is that you have to checkin on a semi regular basis to find things. TJ Maxx is another place where you can get reasonable deals. And just watch the sales from the major stores. These coats are past season, and are probably on sale right now. Try Kohls or other major department stores.
