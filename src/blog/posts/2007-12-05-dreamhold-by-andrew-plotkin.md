As a postscript to my last entry: I realize some of you will be curious to try out interactive fiction right away. I recommend you start with Andrew Plotkin's _[Dreamhold](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/dreamhold.html)_, both because it's designed as an entry point for people who played too many bad pieces of IF in the eighties and gave up, and because you don't have to [download Frotz to play it](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/ftp/dreamhold-frotz.zip). It's playable as [a web browser applet](http://www.eblong.com/zarf/zplet/dreamhold.html).

Wait, but I want it for Frotz... Oh look, even a link to a Palm Frotz, too. Excellent. I've loved the IF from the first, and I'd like to be able to recommend an intro to the genre, like this appears to be, to first-timers. I should look for a converted Colossal Caves sometime, too.
