I'm sorry, Battlestar Galactica. [I didn't mean it.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/186207.html) So you had a couple of bad episodes. It happens to us all. You're only human. Well, mostly. I can forget the bad and focus on the good. And it is so good! You and me, BSG. You and me.

\*\*Whew\*\* I'm glad to hear that, actually. I haven't caught up to the current episodes yet, and I would have been very sorry to quit. I'd like to ask a question, though: I heard that there were "webisodes" that bridge the gap between season 2 and season 3. Is it necessary to locate these "webisodes" to keep up with the plot?

No, it's not strictly necessary. I didn't know about them, in fact. Thanks for tuning me in to it!

Except they're not only human. They're sucky excuses for Cylons.

I take it you finally saw the season three finale. If you haven't, the last 5 minutes are awesome. The music and the emotion was just incredible, its something that is best viewed on wide-screen tv with a surround speakers with the volume turned way up!!
