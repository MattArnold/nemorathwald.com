I am in Ann Arbor for the duration. In addition to serving as Ops and Reg, I made the program book this year. Here it is as a [web-ready PDF](http://www.ucon-gaming.org/downloads/Ucon2009BookFinal.pdf) (1.22MB), and a [re-paginated PDF](http://www.ucon-gaming.org/downloads/Ucon2009BookPrinterSpreads.pdf) (1.19MB) that you can print, fold, and staple into your own booklet.
