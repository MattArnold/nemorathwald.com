Tim Schmidt informs me over long-distance tech support that I mistakenly downloaded the bare-bones "alternate" version. I was impatient to get Ubuntu version 7.10 codename Gutsy Gibbon, on a day when millions of people around the world were all trying to download it at once; so I ganked it from a server that put up the wrong version by mistake. The correct FULL version has a Live CD included. So it puts you into a fully usable desktop, with a big 'install' button. Instead what I had was a text-based install, which should have been my first clue. It's so easy to create an Ubuntu Linux server, you can do it without realizing it.

Yep, having the right install ISO is a big factor. I'm trying to fix a laptop right now. A IBM Thinkpad T40. The hopefully right parts are on the way. It will be a big boost in my current laptop power to the tune of a processor three times as fast as I have now. Fingers crossed. BTW the Wendsday Nov 14 SMOS dinner is something I can make. I'm penciling you in.
