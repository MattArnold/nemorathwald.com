I am finding the British idiom "couldn't be arsed" very useful in the context of the annual Penguicon programming fail parade. "...couldn't be arsed to tell the presenters before the con when their talks are scheduled." "...couldn't be arsed to write one sentence for the program book describing a Nifty Guest." "...couldn't be arsed to respond to the simplest email." "...couldn't be arsed to read their own itinerary." "...couldn't be arsed to attend even one concom meeting."

I don't.... I just don't understand how people can do that. I mean, there's a reason I don't volunteer for stuff, cause I know I don't have the time/money/energy to work on it. I just don't get people who shirk tasks they've willingly taken on.

I expect it's usually over-optimism.

_"...couldn't be arsed to attend even one concom meeting."_ On the other hand, I recall getting a Gchat from you saying you were stumping for me at a Penguicon meeting, and thinking "you know what also might have been great? Telling me there was a meeting so I could come and stump for myself." Presumably, other volunteers entered through a different path and know where to find a schedule for meetings. But a little extra communication often goes a long way.
