*   I've looked forward to watching ["Cold Souls"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127877/) ever since I heard about it.
*   It invites comparisons to "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", but is not written by Charlie Kaufman.
*   Paul Giamatti takes the lead role... as himself.
*   Do you think he will ever be able to eat chickpeas again?
*   +1 for the steampunk goggles.
*   I laughed the hardest at one of his acting performances, when I realized he had started a Shatner impersonation.
