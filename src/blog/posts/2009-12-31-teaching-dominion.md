I taught Zeke, our ferret, to play Dominion. I got Dominion for Christmas, and am so in love with this card game that I've been teaching everyone to play it. Good grief, training ferrets is exponentially harder than herding cats! Plus, he can't shuffle because he doesn't have thumbs. That's fine, I do it for him. He leaves his cards face-up and I politely don't look at them. He keeps forgetting he does _not_ need to discard the Moat when it protects him from an attack. You're probably thinking I'm pretty mean. Oh, please. What do you take me for? I take a handicap when I play against him. He has fun. During my visit to Cleveland, I taught Bella the pug dog to play Dominion. She never misunderstood the Moat. At one point she had two Throne Rooms, and I could tell from the look of indecision in her little pug dog eyes, just what was on her mind. She wasn't sure what happens when you Throne Room another Throne Room. I reassured her that everyone is confused about that. Dogs are so smart.

I suppose is says something about my respect for the extremes you are capable of pursuing that I needed to get a few sentences in to be absolutely certain this was a humor post. (:

I am halfway certain that the ferret can now beat me at this game.
