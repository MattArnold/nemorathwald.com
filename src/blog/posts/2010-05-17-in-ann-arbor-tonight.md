I'm going to Ann Arbor for a U-Con concom meeting, from 6:30 until probably about 7:30 or 8:00. After that I will stay in town until about 10:00. Does anyone in that area want to hang out?

Bill, Moonbeam, myself, and possible others may be playing laser tag tonight. Tuesdays are $4 game night at ZapZone.
