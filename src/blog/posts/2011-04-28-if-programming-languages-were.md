For those who enjoyed the [comparison of programming languages to literature genres](http://yuki-onna.livejournal.com/426022.html), here is and [If Programming Languages Were Religions](http://www.itu.dk/courses/BPRD/E2010/religion.txt). Silly me, when I read the title, I silently wished that Python would be listed as secular. And it was! I find that obscurely pleasing, for no good reason. :) Bonus: [If Programming Languages Were Music Genres.](http://paraschopra.com/blog/philosophy/music-genres-and-programming-languages.htm) [If Programming Languages Were Cars.](http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~mvanier/hacking/rants/cars.html)

FORTH LOVE IF HONK THEN ! I like it. But I think LOVE would need two arguments -- maybe one was just left over on the stack. Perl as poetry is dead on. That list fell down on the .Net, though.

Good stuff! Never realized how many religions I'd pseudo-sampled and left behind, including some in my youth that are now too ancient to be remembered. Now if only I'd supplied a holy book of rituals and ceremonies instead of user documentation for all those code interpreters I created, I could have filed for a tax-free status.
