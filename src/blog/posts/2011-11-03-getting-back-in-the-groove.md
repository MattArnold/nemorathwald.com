Don't forget, tomorrow night is the first evening of the new bi-weekly gaming group at the i3Detroit hacker space in Ferndale! I've been hanging out at i3Detroit more and more, now that I have gas and a car again. Right at this moment, I'm co-hosting the Toad Elevating Moment on Dementia Radio with my friend . I have also been laser-cutting stuff in recent days. I served ice cream made with liquid nitrogen at the Halloween party here. It was great! Cabin fever was really getting to me for a while. Now I'm more contented than I've been in months.
