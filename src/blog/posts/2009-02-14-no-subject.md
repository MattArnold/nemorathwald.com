Hey, don't worry about my coffee, folks! Tonight at the SMOS dinner I heard some people were concerned, after reading the recent comments I made on my ConFusion report, saying "did you hear when Matt broke the carafe of his last machine, he went for a long time without coffee, because he didn't know you could buy a replacement carafe?" The carafe is super-convenient but not required. Espresso machines don't have heater plates like a drip coffee machine does. Just a grille to catch spills. They dispense an amount of beverage that fits in a shot glass. For my last espresso machine, I just used a styrofoam cup, or a shot glass, or whatever was lying around. Heck, I use the bottom of a Mrs. Dash shaker to tamp down the grounds in the basket. It's all good. I never went without coffee. Glassware is kind of my mortal enemy anyway. Heh heh. I'm winning that fight.

Track down Thursday's episode of The Daily Show. You could probably appreciate it, judging by this entry.
