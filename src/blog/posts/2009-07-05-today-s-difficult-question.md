I have been paid to draw a salesperson deceiving people in exchange for money. What gender and race should the salesperson be?

Caucasian/Generic. Anything else would be perceived as stereotypical.

the image that springs immediately to mind is the steroptypical used car salesman. white, slicked back hair, shifty expression, loud sport jacket, one hand behind the back with crossed fingers to signify deceit. in my head, he's named 'ralph' for no apparent reason.

_the image that springs immediately to mind is the stereotypical used car salesman._ Exactly. Venturing far from this might be ill-advised.

A olde English Catholic Friar perhaps? He just said salesman.

I'd go for the "Herb" character on WKRP in Cincinnati - classic.

Ask the client if they have a preference.

The basic problem is that since white men are the cultural standard, if you depart from that many people will infer that you are commenting on whatever group you use a representative of.

I was thinking of a real estate broker, actually. Could be of any gender or race.

Could be any, but has to be _one_. Which one do you choose?

Depends on what effect you have in mind. For what it's worth, I think of the "typical" real estate broker as a motherly-looking woman in late middle age, probably Caucasian, which fits in with the idea of not offending minorities.

Make them a clown. Then you don't have to choose.

Can you get away with just using hands in outline form?
