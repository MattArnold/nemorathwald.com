I am writing this from inside the locked foyer of the Halle Library at EMU. I did not know before I left for work that the weather was this bad. My commute took two hours. I spent another hour with some helpful guys who stopped to tow me out of a snowbank on Washtenaw Avenue. By that time, it became clear the school was probably closed, but in for a penny, in for a pound. I found a clear place to park in a strip mall in front of a closed Blockbuster, and hiked through the snowbanks quite a bit farther than normal. When I got to the building, I caught a fellow employee leaving just before the door closed behind him. He was the last out. I convinced him to let me into the foyer so I could take off my wet shoes and socks and prevent possible frostbite, before heading back out.
