There's a verse in the bible that says "be ye not drunk with wine, but be drunk with the spirit." If religions were beverages and faith were alcohol, [Universism](http://www.universism.org/) would be [O'Douls.](http://www.odouls.com/) For those of us who used to be raging irresponsible abusive drunks when we got high on god, this is welcome news. For those who drink faith in moderation, like [Unitarian Universalists,](http://www.uua.org/) I suppose the equivalent of O'Douls is not necessary. But teetotalism is the right choice for those of us who find the analogy of driving and boating under the influence a tragically appropriate metaphor for our own experiences. Sometimes we were the pedestrian victim, other times we were passengers, some times we were the drivers. Other people can handle it... you're welcome to it. Don't worry, I believe in freedom of religion, so I'm not going to advocate restricting religious education until you're twenty-one years of age with valid ID. I'm referring specifically to "faith" as "alternative ways of knowing." Such as, for instance: Trusting mystical revelations of authorities."Knowing" through a firm inner conviction. Tossing a coin. Consulting a magic 8-ball. Like the UUs, Universism does not concern itself with what you believe. But unlike the UUs, it is quite insistent on the method, the process of coming to conclusions. There is only one deal-breaker in Universism, and that is that Universists do not exempt their beliefs from accountability to reason, experience, argument and evidence. And of course, if you exploit those things only far enough to discredit them, so you can discard them whenever you're losing an argument (and then hold us to them when it suits you), you are not a Universist. That's the only non-Universist conclusion you can come to. If others wish to make such an exemption, fine. This is not a condemnation of non-Universists, just a definition of what it is to be a Universist.

That is a very good analogy with religion and alcohol. I like the occasional glass of wine or margarita now and then, and the same applies to religion. I like to believe in a higher being with a grand purpose and meaning to sooth my emotions. I once had very powerful religious feelings but my religion is no longer vodka but a light wine spritzer...
