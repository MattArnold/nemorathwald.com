**Heavenly Perfection** You're 79% Poly =) 85% tolerant of the poly lifestyle =) (But... you're 26% just in it for the sex =))

Ooooooohhhh Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh You're poly. You're tolerant of poly lifestyle. (Good for you, you like yourself!) You're not just here for the sex. And you won't lie to your mate. I \*Like\* YOU. Congratualtions on being a pretty good person =)

My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people _your age and gender_:

I appear to be 78% poly: the amusing thing is the comparison of certain variables compared to others of my age and gender: My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people _your age and gender_:

I think the test is saying there are almost no polyamorous, tolerant, sexual or honest people of your age and gender. I have no idea whether that's true. Eric has written essays that make me think he would have a comment on the topic. If this test is to be believed, every person on my friends list who's taken it is intrinsically Polyamorous by nature. I have to wonder about that.

_I think the test is saying there are almost no polyamorous, tolerant, sexual or honest people of your age and gender._ Not at all. It's saying that almost no other people of my age and gender _took the test_. And that's probably true. Most people in my age and gender bracket (female, over 40) who hold such beliefs likely don't think of them as "polyamory," which is a fairly new term; they probably think of it as "swinging" or "open marriage" or one of the older, less accurate terms people used when I was growing up. Even those people in my demographic who do think of themselves as polyamorists are probably not reading the section of LJ where such quizzes are posted. Eric is a good example. He's polyamorous, and he certainly blogs, but he has no interest in LiveJournaling; he has a political comment blog instead, and is not exposed to this type of quiz. _If this test is to be believed, every person on my friends list who's taken it is intrinsically Polyamorous by nature. I have to wonder about that._ What's to wonder about? Not at all. They're your friends, and like attracts like. So in a sense they're a population that's self-selected to be open to polyamory.

I came up as very much a non-poly :) But I'm tolerant, honest and not in things for the sex (usually!).

I don't get it. The first time I took the test it scored me at 1% poly and 1% tolerant. I can understand the 1% poly. I've been burned way too many times to be secure enough to share the ones that I love. But 1% tolerant? Give me a break! I was unable to capture my original results. So I tried again. The second time around I got 20% poly and 20% tolerant. I'm -pretty- sure I gave the same answers both times. Go figure.
