I've been using Adobe products in the workplace for years and have purchased more than one for home use. While waiting for them to load, I often would browse the credits in the splash screen. One name in the Photoshop credits always jumped out at me -- "Seetharanan Narayanan." Wow, I thought. How could you top a mellifluous name like that for a software engineer? Well [this photo tour of Adobe headquarters](http://photoshopnews.com/feature-stories/a-visit-to-adobe/) (which looks exactly as I imagined Adobe headquarters would look), finally put a face to the name!
