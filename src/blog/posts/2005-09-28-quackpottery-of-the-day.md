As many of you know, I'm fascinated by unintentional humor created by those who, while remaining fully functional in our society, are gullible to the point of mental illness. Someone on my lj friends list (who in recent weeks has felt herself to be on the verge of inventing The Grandiose Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything) consulted her [Mayan Astrological Reading](http://www.astrodreamadvisor.com/free_mayan_readings.html). Did you know, according to the "Dreamspell Galactic Signature", I am a Galactic Activation Portal? ;) Whoo-hoo. Who knew those Mayans were so in tune with the galaxies? As usual with fortunetelling, the handwaving pronouncements of today's Quackpottery are utterly devoid of content. One thing I can say in its favor though, is that the output of the Dreamspell Calculator is very colorful and pretty. It's no worse than any livejournal meme quiz. Check it out. You know what though? Recently commented that he felt like the characters in the webcomic [Bruno](http://brunostrip.com/bruno.html) are similar to the dramatis personae of his own life. This caused me to look on many of my acquaintances, and some of my loved ones, with whom I am occasionally annoyed, in a new light. My mood has been lightened on many occasions by this viewpoint. If they are characters in the sitcom of my life, I want it to be interesting. Would I really rather be surrounded by boring people? I think not. This is why I treasure a spectrum of "lunatic" fringes like a garden of exotic flowers. As long as they can function and aren't hurting anybody, I actually feel great affection for the reality-impaired, and hope to keep them around.

I think _reality-impaired_ describes a lot of my family, and a few of my friends.

Well then, I hope you'll find the comic-strip analogy helpful to you in your relationships and state of mind.

Actually, comic-strips with on-going stories don't hold my attention, I usually "don't get" them.

Big whoop. I'm also a Galactic Activation Portal. ;)

Of course, when it comes to being reality impaired, you realize that you've just traded one fundamentalist reality tunnel for another, don't you? I had a good chuckle over the mayan horoscope -- put together by someone who's very bright and creative, and even more ungrounded than you. ;-)

One of the side-effects of using the Bruno technique is that one begins to actively cultivate one's own role in the comic strip of other people's lives.
