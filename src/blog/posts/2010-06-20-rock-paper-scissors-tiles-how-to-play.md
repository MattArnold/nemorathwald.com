With a video camera, I can finally start showing all of you the games I have invented over the years. [I invented this game in 2008.](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/237753.html) I have since fixed a couple of issues and have put the new version of the rules in this post below the cut. **The Rules of Rock Paper Scissors Tiles** **Equipment:** ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000bf555) 1. Forty-eight identical square tiles that are divided diagonally into two colors on the front side. These instructions will assume they are black and white. 2. A table (not included). **Setup:** 1\. Leave a clear space on the table and place the tiles in reach of the players. 2. Choose which player is which color from the two colors on your tiles. 3. There is no step 3. **Procedure:** 1. Simultaneously, each player takes a tile from the supply. 2. Hiding the front side from the opponent, each player positions their tile upright with its edge on the table. 3. Simultaneously, when their tiles are both touching the table, the players tip their tiles toward each other so the tiles are laying down on the table. 4. Repeat. On the first turn, when there are no tiles on the table, the first tiles should touch each other at the edge. From then on, a tile must be positioned so that it will touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played. Step 2 is only simultaneous on the first turn. Starting with the second turn, Black chooses a location for his/her tile, then White chooses the location for his/her tile. On the next turn, it is White then Black. This order alternates on each turn. **Scoring:** Players attempt to form the following three shapes with their own color and the opponent's color: ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000betyz) Scissors cut paper, paper covers rock, rock breaks scissors. You are looking for pairs of shapes that do this, such as a Black rock which crushes a White scissors. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has more winning shape combinations on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw. It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes. For example, a White scissors and White paper can share two tiles and still qualify as two complete shapes. **Strategy Basics:** Pay attention to what structures your opponent is building, and disrupt them if necessary. Remember, with every tile, you are placing your own color and your opponent's color. "Telegraph punches that you're not throwing." Get your opponent to believe you're building toward a particular victory, and suddenly switch to build a different one. **The Absurdly Unplayable "Elements Expansion"!** ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000bgfws)

Are we going to be playtesting that sometime soon?
