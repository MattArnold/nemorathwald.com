We got in late Tuesday night to PyCon in Chicago. I spent today in on-the-job training, trying to learn by watching and by doing. At first, the best I could do was avoid getting underfoot. Now I'm setting up microphones, operating the sound boards and video cameras, and using software on a laptop that cuts between views of the presenter and his or her presentation. It's fun. Yesterday and today are pre-conference tutorial sessions. On Friday the conference begins. During a break, I met another member of the AV team, Brandon Rhodes, Editor in Chief of [Python Magazine](http://pythonmagazine.com/). I'm typing this during a break. Got to go now.

You do have a stack of resumes to hand out, right?

No. To who? For doing what? They're surrounded by several thousand more qualified Python programmers at this event. Although, I did exchange business cards for possible freelance work in graphic design.

Bingo. Every programmer has a lot of other folks around him doing the sort of stuff you do. It takes a village to get (say) a video game out the door.
