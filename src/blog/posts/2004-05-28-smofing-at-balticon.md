I'm sitting behind the Operations desk at [Balticon](http://www.balticon.org). I left Roseville, Michigan at 4 AM and arrived in Baltimore, Maryland at 2:30 PM. The first thing that happened was discovering [Stoner Fluxx](http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/StonerFluxx/Default.html). There are a lot of fans of Looney Labs Games in this area since this is where the Looneys live. I myself am a Looney Lab Rabbit. Earl Newton of [Southern Ronin Productions](http://www.southernronin.com) was interviewing random attendees in the lobby for a documentary about _Fall of a Saga_, a parody expose about George Lucas, showing here this weekend. After being interviewed, I went to the volunteering desk. I volunteered to work and fell into SMOFing immediately. The conchair is named Dale Arnold (no relation), and his feet hurt from running around this hotel making the convention come together. I myself, by contrast, have driven for nine hours and my feet are eager to walk around. In exchange for my volunteer work they offer a free membership in next year's convention, or a t-shirt, or preferred seating at events. But all I wanted was crash space. However, this con does not have such a room. So I asked to be given a wide range of experience instead. One of my purposes here is to research for Michigan conventions, and I'm grilling them with endless questions about how they managed to get live skits and amateur fan films. I am, as of this typing, left alone to handle Ops for a convention I only heard about two weeks ago. And doing an OK job might I add. And I haven't even registered yet. This is going to be a fun weekend.
