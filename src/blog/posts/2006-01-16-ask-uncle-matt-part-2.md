It's time once again for "[Ask Uncle Matt](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/73302.html)," the part of the blog in which I delight and confuse you. _Dear Uncle Matt, This weekend I will be attending a science fiction and fantasy literature convention in Troy, Michigan called [ConFusion](http://www.stilyagi.org/cons/2006/). While I am there, where can I feed my need for erotic rice crispie treats? -Crispy Creme_ Dear Crispy, you can find erotic rice crispie treats at ConverStation, the room party of [ConVersation.](http://www.con-versation.com/) -Uncle Matt
