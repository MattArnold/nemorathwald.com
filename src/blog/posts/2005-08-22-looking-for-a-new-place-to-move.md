I've enjoyed living here, but John is moving out in a few months and so the time has come once again to find a new room to rent. It's become slightly more complicated by the fact that during the past twelve months (but not at any time which I can actually point to) R has moved in with me. I don't think it will make it all that much more complicated though. I continue to want to rent a room that's really really cheap. I was told that a mortgage would probably cost the same as what I'm currently paying in rent; in fact, it was $50 to $100 a month more. I could possibly tighten my belt and accept that. But insurance, property tax and maintenance on top of that place house ownership ludicrously out of my reach. My last livejournal announcement to this effect resulted in the lodgings I have today. Any more suggestions? I'd appreciate it!

Buy the house already. And rent out a couple rooms. Believe me, you'll come out way ahead on that deal. And maintenance really isn't that big a deal if you get a decent house. Come on...you know you want to... :)

Two things -- yes, I'm going to be starting to look to buy a house this fall, but that will take awhile. You're probably good through the end of the year. And our landlady will be looking to sell the house next spring, so you may be able to work something out with her to extend that. Some money coming in is better than none, but you would be responsible for the utilities, and that may not be cost effective. Secondly, I echo the "Buy the house already" meme. You will get tax write offs for the property taxes and the interest. Also, at your earning level, you will get a nice refund with the Homestead refund stuff for the state of Michigan. And yes, you can rent a room or two, and that income will make it affordable. And this is the one thing that's going to rehabilitate your credit history.

OK, I'll keep trying to see if I can buy some kind of house. The call goes out to the LJ list for potential roomies!

You can get a homestead credit on rent, too, so look into that for your current taxes.

If you truly do not want to buy a house/condo, there are other options. One is to try to find an apartment that includes heat/water in your rent. They do exist, and it is a lot easier to deal with that way. My rent is HALF what my house payment was, and water is included - I do have to pay the heat, but it's not nearly as bad as it was with the house. My rent (without pet fees) is $590. That also includes renters insurance on the apartment itself AND on contents ($15 per month of the rent). You can also find someone who needs help with yard work or some other service, and get a break on the rent that way. It's not as ideal for most people, but it can work.

Matt, on the flip side of that last sentence, if you are the landlord, you could offer a modest discount to someone who is good with maintenance and save yourself part of the headache while you learn the ins and outs of home ownership. Maybe rent a room to someone in a construction trade who has some experience.

That would be my good friend Blasted Bill. Who, it so happens, is looking for someone to live with in exchange for construction work. However, living together is enough to strain any relationship, which is why living with anybody who I'm really good friends with evokes mixed feelings in me.

I got a call over the weekend from someone who is looking for a room to rent, she needs somewhere to go asap. I lived with her before; she's quiet, neat, and she's gone a lot. She used to have a bird that screamed a lot but she has since replaced it with a cat which she volunteered to keep closed in her room because it doesn't play well with others.

I forgot to say, let me know if you want me to introduce you to her.
