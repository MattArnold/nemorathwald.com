Bill's girlfriend , who runs The Flying Hamster of Doom Internet Radio Hour, made my day by saying nice things about my writing. I think my self-image is being mis-proportionately affected by spending too much time on internet forums full of people who hate me and see the world in a fun-house mirror reflection of my own. Such correction is valuable, but a balance should be struck.

Just in case there was any confusion about that journal entry, bluehamster98 is not one of the people in the forums who hate me. She brings balance to the force.
