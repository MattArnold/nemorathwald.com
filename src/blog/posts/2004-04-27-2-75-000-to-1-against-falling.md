I had a phone conversation last night that has left me with more questions than answers. If you have engaged an Infinite Improbability Drive, kindly turn it off. The time has come for realism to deliberately assert itself. If an infinite number of monkeys appeared outside my window, scratching at the frame and waving manuscripts in ink-stained fingers, demanding to show me a screenplay they've written, I would be slightly less surprised than I am now. I'll write tomorrow when I know more. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it." Again came the voice. "Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling." Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. "Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on and is there any way of stopping it?" "Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, "you are perfectly safe." "But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a perfectly safe penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!" "It's alright, I've got them back now," said Arthur. "Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," said the voice. "Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, but..." "Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you ought to be telling us?" The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance. "Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold." The voice continued. "Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against-possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling." -- from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams
