I did pretty well on the written portion of my Java midterm. I may have aced it. That sounds more flattering than it really is, because my teacher is kind: he allowed me to stay and finish during the subsequent class that he teaches in the same room. Yeah, it took me that long. Now I'm working on the next part, which is creating a poker card program. It's due Saturday at 9 PM. I will be doing little else, in order to finish it by the Penguicon concom meeting on Saturday.
