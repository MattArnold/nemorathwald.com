This is my daydream today. Imagine that we live in a post-scarcity society. We take high-speed planes or subterranean trains that acheive orbital speeds in vacuum-pressurized tunnels to commute transcontinentally to work. Or we telecommute. [Our houses float](http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/BigIdeas/Images/balloon.html) with autonomous utilities and water recycling. We can travel and socialize and be at home, all at the same time. The offline world is becoming more like the internet: physical location is not so demanding anymore. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0005zfac) As a result, some of the social circles in SF/F fandom take over an [abandoned Russian children's park.](http://www.abandoned.ru/thumb.php?gal=9) We mow it, clean it, and fix it, similar to the ad-hocracy depicted running Disney World in Cory Doctorow's [_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom._](http://craphound.com/down/) We hold a convention there as our homes temporarily occupy the sky above the park. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/00060p14)

It's a lot of work to go back and tag my posts retroactively. I've only got as far as March.
