My friends at [The Logical Language Group](http://www.lojban.org/) made a last-minute announcement of Logfest 2005. The Philadelphia science fiction convention [Philcon](http://www.philcon.org/2005/) has set aside a room in which to hold the intermittently-recurring celebration of the Lojban language, December 9 through 11. I'm thrilled by this announcement. They can expect to see me there. You have no idea how long I have wanted there to be a LogFest-- the last one took place before I was involved in the language. For a whiIe I was idly toying with renting a hall in Maryland and organizing one myself. Too bad it's too late to get Lojban badge ribbons! There are several reasons that this trip is financially possible. I have a habit of not getting a hotel room at a convention, because somehow it always just works out. For instance, in this case I'll probably just sleep in my sleeping bag on the floor in a room that one of the Lojbanists gets. I almost always volunteer to be a gopher and work for six hours (or eight, or however many is necessary) so I'll get my registration reimbursed. I enjoy learning how another convention operates so that I can bring that knowledge back to running Michigan science fiction conventions. I [just found out](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/101050.html) I have twice as much vacation time this year as I thought, so I was looking for a way to spend it because it doesn't roll over to next year. Here's a use for two of the days! I'll reserve it tomorrow. One of my best friends lives in Philadelphia and I can see him. Maybe I can park my car at his house and he'll drive me to the convention on Friday so I can avoid a parking fee. Isn't it working out well? I'm excited!
