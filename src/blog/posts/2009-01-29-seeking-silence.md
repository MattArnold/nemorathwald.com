I have agreed to record a podcast for a highly-reputable audio fiction magazine. When I went to record it, I turned off the computer fans and other noise sources in the apartment, and realized my environment has more sound than I normally notice. There is rap next door, cars honk in the streets, and dogs bark in the adjacent apartments. I just got back from WCC, where all the group study rooms in the library were occupied. The music department does not have any soundproof rooms for musicians to practice. Can anyone suggest or offer someplace less than half an hour from Ypsilanti, with electricity and ten minutes of silence?

invest in a cardioid microphone? This is what singers in large amplified concerts use. It's design damps ambient noise.

Possibly a college or public radio station in the area that might allow you use of a studio?

Oh! That reminds me that Washtenaw Community College has a radio studio in their student center! Thank you!

The main branches of many public libraries have "study rooms" one can check out for thirty minutes at a time.
