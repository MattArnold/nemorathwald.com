James Dobson surrendered his role in Christian engagement in politics in the May 14 broadcast of _Focus on the Family_. Dobson told his listeners he would not ask them to write or call their representatives in Congress, as any route other than prayer is hopeless, at least as long as the executive and legislative branches are Democrat-controlled. The organization, founded by Dobson, is [one of the foremost leaders of the Dominionist edge of the Religious Right](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_on_the_Family#Political_positions_and_activities). Dominionism is an ideology within extreme branches of some religions that endorses control of the state by religious teaching-- and by extension, control of your church by someone else's church. FotF uses the radio show and a media empire of magazines, animated cartoons and audio dramas to oppose abortion rights and gay rights and promote the teaching of Creationism. FotF media empire also spun off a 501(c)(4) political action group, _Focus Action_. [USA Today's article about Dobson giving up](http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/05/15/does-dobson-really-want-christians-to-disengage-from-politics.html) noted with interest that this episode contained a second first-time occurance to take place in the thirty years of the _Focus on the Family_ 501c(3) radio ministry. Dobson made no attempt to conceal that he is an outlet of the Republican party.

Not surprising. He can now claim when the conservative/religious right is back in power (hopefully never, but history doesn't side with the progressive very long) that any swing left and the ensuing backlash is because he subsequently (and his followers) stopped praying for country and then when back in power it's because of his and his believer's "strong" faith. Purely a power move. Even if it is obviously craven from the outside looking in. On a related note perhaps he hopes it also saves his organization from the Obama administration's eventual investigation of non-profits pushing political agendas. (and being stripped of non-profit status because of reasons.)

I'm completely comfortable with him focusing all his energy on praying. I'll continue to write my representatives. What a lovely gift Dobson has given the rest of us.
