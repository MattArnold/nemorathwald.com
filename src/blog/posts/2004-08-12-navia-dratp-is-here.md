I'm arranging a gathering of [SEMI Abstract Gamers](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/semi-abstract-gamers/) at my house on Saturday to celebrate the official release date of the new commercially-produced chess variant for which I have waited so long. So, I called up [Masquerade Games](http://www.masquerade-games4anime.bigstep.com/homepage.html) today to see if they could confirm that [Navia Dratp](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Games.htm#naviadrapt) would be on their shelves on Saturday. "We just got that in today," she said. "We were wondering what the heck it is." So, I went right over there after work, bought both starter sets and played the game against Rachel. It's as fun and beautifully-crafted as I imagined. Time to update my [Navia Dratp page on chessvariants.com](http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/naviadratp.html)!

It was indeed a fun and beautiful game. I'm sure when I get used to the rules I'll whip you for trouncing me last night. He he he. Rachel :-)

I will go out and buy light wine spritzers for you immediately, to ensure my permanent victory.
