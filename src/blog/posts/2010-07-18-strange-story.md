My friend Will and I shot a film this afternoon with his sisters. Afterward, his dad was swimming in their pool, when he saw us walking toward him across the field. His daughter guided me by the wrist as I gingerly picked my way through the alfalfa. I was wearing only boxer shorts and dark brown slime, which dripped from my head to coat most of my body. "What happened to you?" he cried as they hosed me down. "I lost my glasses." The brownie mix would take too long to explain to him. As for you, you will just have to wait for it to hit Youtube. The cast and crew spent ten minutes hunting through the dense underbrush for my glasses, to no avail. Fortunately Will was my ride, so I didn't have to drive home. I can't find my old glasses anywhere, and am pretty sure I threw them away. I have just now ordered new glasses, which will arrive between 1 week and 2.5 weeks. I think I can drive if I have to, but it is not a good idea if I can avoid it. My classes are Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings, 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, at the corner of Ford Rd and Evergreen Rd in Dearborn. This weekend is Southern Michigan Arts and Creativity Conference at the Dearborn Doubletree right nearby there. Can anyone give me a ride at some point?

Ever heard of Pinhole Glasses? Basically, you take some flat material, poke a grid of nice round holes in it, look through the holes, and you get a decently improved view. There are plenty of guides on the web, one of my favorites using duck tape, several using tin foil. I can testify that these work OK in a pinch, so long as you make the holes nicely round. Just search "Pinhole Glasses" or "Emergency Glasses". If you still need a ride Tuesday, Nikki and I could give you a ride to class. Give me a call or IM to set up details.

I've heard of pinhole _cameras_. And based on the known workings of a camera I would have supposed the pinhole to function as a _convex_ lens. I would guess that Matt, like most people who use glasses for distance vision, uses _concave_ lenses, which do rather the opposite with light. BTW Matt, If you don't mind telling, how many Diopters of correction do you use?
