Wow. [I asked for signatories, and got testimonials!](http://community.livejournal.com/penguicon/67771.html) I'm blown away. It's times like this that affirm for me, if I had needed it, that I have spent my effort becoming rich after all. The phrase is a cliche, but it works so well. I'm rich in friends. I know what some of you are thinking: I can't possibly take on any more responsibilities. But working for Escape Artists Inc. is the right move for me, both in vision _and_ pragmatism. This isn't a hobby, it's paying work. I need extra income, and this has obvious advantages over its pay-rate competitor, McDonalds, both in specialized interest and flexible hours. I know where to cut from my schedule to make time for it without sacrificing [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org). My current full-time temp day job won't last forever. Did you know [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org/) is the second largest market for short fiction? It has more listeners than _Asimov's_ or _The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction_ have readers. Only _Analog_ magazine has a larger subscriber base. Perhaps even more important than its significance to the lifeblood of genre fiction is the pioneering of forward-looking internet business models. That intersection is where I belong. Imagine the networking advantages that might accrue to the gatekeeper. Some might also question, if this is so desirable, why it is that I am publicizing and promoting it where, perhaps, a potential competitor might read it. It's no problem. (1) I want the job to go to whoever fits it best, even if it's not me. (2) It is me.

I wanted to ask why you were soliciting signatories - this seems a rather unusual way of giving a potential employer references, and I didn't see such a request made in the job ad.

I did it because I think it speaks volumes, and because I spent the whole day trying to think up new ways to turn the volume up, so to speak. Steve Eley is not some bored drone in the Human Resources department wearing a necktie. I'll reserve the standard methods for when I look for wage-slave jobs in cubicle farms.

You know, Matt, not everyone who works in HR is a "bored drown earing a neck tie" and not everyone who goes looking for "normal" jobs is a "wage-slave in a cubicle farm."

Yes. Far be it from me to say they are.

If I understand your comment correctly, it goes more to the point to say that the sort of people who usually write references are colleagues or employers. For a job such as this, an enormous mass of satisfied "customers" is a good thing to add to that.
