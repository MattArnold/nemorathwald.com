From BoingBoing.net: _[Astronomer Sues NASA](http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=oddlyEnoughNews&storyID=2005-07-05T134242Z_01_L04309275_RTRIDST_0_ODD-RUSSIA-HOROSCOPE-DC.XML) A Russian astrologist who says NASA has altered her horoscope by crashing a spacecraft into a comet is suing the U.S. space agency for damages of $300 million, local media reported Monday. "It is obvious that elements of the comet's orbit, and correspondingly the ephemeris, will change after the explosion, which interferes with my astrology work and distorts my horoscope," Izvestia daily quoted astrologist Marina Bai as saying in legal documents submitted before Monday's collision._ So, what do you think, friends list? Anybody want to support the idea that she has a case?

My husband and I were talking about that. So ridiculous. If humans are part of nature, then why would anything they do mess up how astrology works? And why didn't astrologers see this turn of events comming?

Not if she is actually dealing with classical astrology as I understand it. In this case, publishers of astronomy textbooks might as well sue NASA for making the data they have published obsolete... (I dated a guy for two and a half years and held my tongue about his "religious beliefs" in this regard, believing that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion... maybe NASA and I might countersue for the emotional strain of having to endure this sort of silliness?)

Setting aside the astrological implications, the physics of this is that an object the size of a small washing machine collided with an object the size of Manhattan Island. One suspects that change in the orbital path of the larger object will be below the threshold of measurement.
