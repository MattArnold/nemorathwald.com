My current living arrangement is drawing to a close, and the end of July has been set as a target date for me to move out. I'm intensifying my efforts to find a cheap room to rent. Any suggestions? My current temp-to-perm job through my temp agency is near Northwestern Highway and 696 in Southfield. They plan to hire me in a couple of weeks, if I choose that. I have enough money for a deposit equal to a month's rent. I don't smoke or own pets, but I don't care if I live with smoking or pets.

...a reasonable commute, you might want to contact John Guest. His roommate is moving out.

John Guest lives in Oak Park -near Southfield, just in case you're not familiar w/the area - and is looking for a roommate. Send me your phone number and I'll forward it; or call him if you already have that information.

Thanks to you both for this suggestion. Oak Park would be 1/3 of the commute I make now.
