Here is my first animation for Flash class. The instructor told us it should just be a stick figure. So I immediately wanted to animate an xkcd comic strip. recommended [one that contained a simple repeating motion](http://xkcd.com/162/). ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/S2omooR3uiI/AAAAAAAAH2c/hL9DmIudDl8/s800/ArnoldM_Project2-1.gif) **Edited to Add:** The first one was too fast to read comfortably, so I made a new version. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/S2plccgkmGI/AAAAAAAAH2k/RLdo_7UH3l0/s800/ArnoldM_Project2-1v2.gif)

Thank you! I feel greatly encouraged by the thought of what I could do if I give myself more than an hour.

Thanks! I really enjoy animation. There are many soundtracks I'm currently considering adding animation to.

Cool! (Maybe leave the last frame with all the words up for a pinch longer. Some of us are slower readers.) :-D

Good idea. While I'm at it, the whole thing should be slowed down.

As geek and a recently fallen-in-love guy, I like it and post it on my personal blog -- http://elsucuchodeleo.blogspot.com/2010/02/robando-descaradamente-v20.html (in spanish) I hope there won't be any problem! And I agree with plasmonicgrid: it's a little bit fast! (at least by an English speaker wannabe as myself :P)
