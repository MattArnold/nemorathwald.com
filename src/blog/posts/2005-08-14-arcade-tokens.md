BoingBoing.net has a post about [a Flickr photo set: "Many, many photos of old arcade game tokens".](http://www.flickr.com/photos/petromyzon/sets/587315/) This is making me jealous. I used to collect tokens when I was in high school and college. In fact, I still have them. These were given to me from endless sources who I asked to bring back local arcade, transportation or phone tokens from their winter or summer college breaks all over the country and world. I have many tokens shown here and several that aren't. Common ones bring back memories of good times; rare ones make me imagine what fascinations were held in store at the attractions that dispensed them. My favorite is the science coin, the last two photos in the gallery.

I don't know who made it, but it's neat.

They've got both the tokens from the my former employer. Thanks for the memories Matt. There are times (lots more lately for some reason...) that I really miss running my arcades. Too bad Eddie Jr. and Tom gutted the company for cash then sold the remains off to Pocket Change for pennies on the dollar. Pocket Change got screwed in the deal as well. They bit off more then they could chew in the transaction and ended up in a forced sale to Namco.
