I renewed my driver's license this year, and was supposed to renew my tags at the same time. For some reason, when I went to the DMV I only did one of them, and could have sworn I did both. In August I got pulled over for expired tags. I had traffic court today, in which I got my fine reduced. So, I wore a suit and tie. In retrospect, I should have not left the suit and tie on when I went to work. Several people in my office asked if I had an interview for a job somewhere else. I certainly hope my boss doesn't think that.

Say that you had to go to court to fight a ticket. And wink when you say it. Perhaps they'll treat you better if they think they may lose you. It's an interesting ploy to play. (This assumes that they like and value you).

I don't understand why you had to go to court. Last time I got a ticket, the options were: 1) Plead guilty, 2) Plead guilty with an excuse, 3) Plead innocent. Only #3 requires a court trip, and it sounds to me like you did #2. I have often used #2 to get a reduction in the fine/points without spending more money than the ticket is costing by taking time from work to go to court.
