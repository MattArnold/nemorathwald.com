In the [fifth installment](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/10/10/themepunks_5/index_np.html) of his serialized novel ["Themepunks"](http://dir.salon.com/topics/cory_doctorow/) Cory Doctorow uses an idea which occurred to me independently long ago: multiple small dishwashers for bachelor roommate pads. Don't use cupboards, just leave the cleaned dishes in the dishwasher and transfer them to the other dishwasher when they're dirty. It's really just an idea whose time has come.

I hope a big "clean/dirty" flag is part of the deal, kinda like the "occipied/vacant" flag that activates with the lock on an airplane bathroom door. It'd have to be automated, too.
