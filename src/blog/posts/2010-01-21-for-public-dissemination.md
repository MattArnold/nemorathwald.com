Here are the events I will run at [ConFusion](http://confusion.stilyagi.org/) science fiction convention this weekend: **Dominion Tournament**, Saturday, 8 to 10 PM, Mediterranean Room The game that launched the wildly popular deck-building genre. Sets will be drawn from all expansions. **Marionette Construction**, Sunday, 10 to 11 AM, Salon H An instructive slide presentation on construction of eighteen-inch-tall, fourteen-string marionettes. Topics include weights and joints for natural-looking movement; hinged jaw construction; controller design; materials considerations. Performance will be covered briefly. A puppet will be present for you to use and examine. You may recommend these events to random strangers at the convention if it feels comfortable to do so. However, treat them like human beings with a right to their own personal space. Keep a respectful distance while suggesting these events. Be genuinely interested in who they are as people, and not just trying to persuade them to attend these events. If they express a knee-jerk scowl when you speak to them, because of your glasses and Star Wars t-shirt, be understanding. You'd be grouchy too if you couldn't walk through a hotel without being approached by ten different nerds in the hallways about the Puterschien Authority puppetry system, and what happens if you play the Council Room, then Militia, _then_ play the Masquerade card. If they do not wish to attend these events, move along. Do not comment on how suitable their fingers are for cards or puppets-- that is an inappropriate familiarity. In fact, don't look at their hands at all. Others may try to suggest these events very aggressively-- if so, distract or deflect the aggressors in ways that don't make a scene. However, do not exploit your heroism to then try to persuade their target to go with _you_ to these events. I think that covers it, so other than that, go for it!

I see you've been reading a lot of etiquette books. I will endeavor to follow your advice.
