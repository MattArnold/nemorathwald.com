I've compiled my Livejournal entries on science fiction to [a new page on my website.](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/SFandF.htm) Before the internet, these probably would have been Letters Of Comment in a treeware magazine or newsletter.

Of course I can't take credit for coining the term though. Like it?

You're more or less right. Before the Interne, fen wrote comments to each other about SF and other things in informal magazines called APAs. Essentially, someone who wanted to publish one started writing, and agreed to let others contribute. In order to participate, the others had to pay a fee. The idea was that the fee would be used to make enough paper copies (made, in the earliest days, with mimeograph stencils!) to mail every member a copy. Members who lived nearby would come over and help with collating the copies. Generally, APAs published like this once a month. Eric used to be in one or two APAs. Other LiveJournal friends of mine who did the APA thing (I didn't) and can tell you more about it include and .
