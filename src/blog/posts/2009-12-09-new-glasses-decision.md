...which is not to say that any are actually \*un\*acceptable. any of them probably would be acceptable. figured you were shooting to narrow down the options, though.

I actually think A is unacceptable.

Just a personal piece of advise. I would avoid blue, or color in general in a frame. It limits what you can wear with them. I know you could, I guess, just say "to heck with matching" but I am anal retentive, and cannot clash my glasses to my outfit. Just something to consider.

Yes, of the two colors shown in the photo, I would only choose the black. Good advice.

I'll second what said. Avoid the blue. Also, I notice most of them have thick wires to the ears even though they have tiny wires at the actual joint. Ugh. That cuts down on peripheral vision without actually giving you any more stability of the frame. (And for my references: I wore glasses from ages 6 to 22 when I had lasik.)

Thanks! I wouldn't have thought of that about the frame joint.

np. I have opinions about glasses now because when I was little my Dad always made me wear these bottle caps (I had a nasty prescription) thinking it would give me more vision, but they distort so much at the edges it didn't help. And they were so think at the edges they always looked stupid.

What a fantastic idea!!!! I DESPISE picking new frames. Next time, I must take pictures, set up a poll, and get some feedback!!!
