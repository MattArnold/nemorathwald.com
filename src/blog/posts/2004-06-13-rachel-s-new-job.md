Rachel got a much better job as a secretary for a law firm. It's not a temp job this time, it has benefits and excellent pay. This was her first week. Her financial footing is now reasonably secure. This should make up for the flooding her apartment underwent when she was out of state a few weeks ago at a wedding.

Yay! (: Is she thinking of getting an email address at some point? (:

She got a hotmail address but never checks it because she has no computer and no internet connection. But she can afford dialup ISP payments now, and yesterday Bill Putt went a long way towards fixing the issues with all my computers including the one I am going to give to Rachel. So: computer (check) internet connection (check). Maybe she'll actually even use the world wide web when the transformation is complete!

Forgive my ignorance... Rachel is a friend? Or is she a "special friend?" :) Just curious!

I was married to Rachel from 1998 to 2003, so our status is always going to be difficult to define. I had no idea she would continue to hang around as long as she has. As a result we're occasionally almost as unclear on this issue as our friends and family! This should explain to anyone who may have been wondering why she's always driving me places, why I'm always paying for her, and why my grandfather is kindly putting her up while the flood workmen replace her carpeting and drywall. There's nothing like having a history together, even when it was a stupid mistake. Yes, you could call such a friendship special, in a manner of speaking. One of my out-of-state friends who experienced a divorce-- let's just say it was not as amicable as ours-- tells me he thinks it's special in the sense of riding the short bus to school. However, on one thing Rachel and I are agreed without doubt: we are both available and looking. Thanks for asking! :^)

Just Kidding... I know I'm not your type! :)

I'm such a heartbreaker. :^D Changing of subject, that wouldn't be [the first time](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/1391.html) somebody's gaydar misfired around me. I don't know why it happens so often, but I'm guessing it's the turtlenecks. Am I just more gay-attractive, or are men just more willing to make the first move than are women? At Balticon people told me the women were referring to me as cute, but did they tell me this themselves? Of course not. It occasionally makes me feel unlucky that I'm not "heteroflexible," because I'd get more action! But I'm not.

That's interesting, because I have the opposite problem. I have tons of women friends, who are all very nice to me, and many of them tell me that they think I'm rather attractive, and the only guys who ever do that are taken. (And I'm fine with people having open relationships, it's just not something of which I want to partake, personally -- for the most part.) I think men are more willing to make the first move. (That isn't to say that some women aren't willing, but for the most part, men are MORE willing.) But there are people who are more attractive to gay men than to str8 women. Whether or not you're one of those people, I'd guess not, but I can not be sure. :)

_...and the only guys who ever do that are taken._ Hey, once you get to be around our age, everybody's taken. Although, I like to optimistically phrase it that everybody's first marriage hasn't ended yet. Heh heh. Obviously optimism is relative.

You make it sound like we're old! I'm only 25!!

I'm not much older. I'm turning thirty on Thursday. Practically the whole human race wants to be in some kind of exclusive relationship which they fancy to be permanent. There are so many people in this world who are fit to be The One and Only Forever Love for any given person, that between 20 and 25 most people take the plunge with the first One And Only Forever Love who comes along. Considering that the average marriage lasts seven years, 25 to 30 year olds are getting around to being taken by surprise by discovering the second, third or fourth person who would have made an even better One And Only Forever Love. Or at least, one at a time.
