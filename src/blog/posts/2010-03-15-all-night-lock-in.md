I'm at an all-night lock-in at EMU. I was invited to bring my whole game library to run the game room, and talk a lot about Penguicon. These are things that I can do until 9 in the morning!

I wish it had been. I was the only geek there. I did manage to talk a couple of bored people into letting me teach them Carcassonne and Dominion, though.

Figures, I only find out about it now. Well, that's too bad that there wasn't anyone around to play stuff. I presume this was at the student center? Ballroom?

Interestingly, it took place in the College of Business building.
