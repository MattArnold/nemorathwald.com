Kelly Birke mentioned it would be great to have access to a computerized automated embroidery machine. Twenty minutes later, I got Jen to donate hers to i3Detroit if we'd cover the shipping cost. Twenty minutes after that, I had taken up a collection and raised $140. It now sits in i3Detroit's craft room! Maybe we can make Nerd Merit Badges for Penguicon!

You know Birke is my SCA name and not my last name, yes? :) This is fun! I've never had access to an embroidery machine. I look forward to checking it out.

that's what you are known as on the Internet, and I won't "out" you for your real name without your consent.
