[This is a staggering story.](http://www.gastongazette.com/news/bank-58397-richard-hailed.html) He sold everything, settled up with everyone, got a hotel room, mailed a letter of explanation to the newspaper, robbed a random bank for $1, then sat and waited for the police. With multiple ailments making it difficult for him to work, and options such as homeless shelters taking a hit-and-miss chance, he said "I chose jail" for medical care.
