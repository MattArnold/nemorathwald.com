Ganked from . The first five people to respond to this post will get some form of art, by me, specifically for them. I make no guarantees about quality, but your piece will be unique. The only catch, of course, is that as with most memes, if you sign up, you have to put this in your own journal as well.

OK, I confess, I was looking at another artwork when I did this one. It's not _completely_ original. But then, when is anything truly original? ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/photos/robedfighter.jpg)

Wow! You're quite an artist! (are those done by hand and then scanned?) How did you become so talented? Any tips for someone trying to "learn/understand everything" (and live accordingly) when I get to the art part? Also, how specifically does your art degree relate to your current artistic ability/endeavors, since you mentioned somewhere that you found it useless?

Thanks! Some of them were drawn on paper and then scanned, others were painted in the natural media program [ArtRage](http://www.artrage.com/artrage.html) with a touch-sensitive drawing tablet. The cube one was based on a 3D model I built in [Google SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/). My unaccredited degree was almost completely useless to my career. In a field like illustration and graphic design, with such a tough and competitive market, artists must be entrepreneurs. They must study the market, and understand the decisions of a businessman as if they were their own talent agent and strategist. Conditioning students to be drones that obediently follow their authorities the way a child follows a parent is completely inappropriate to build that self-determination. Also, while I was in college I totally forgot my love for art because I did so many boring excercises to be immediately discarded. I was ordered to draw and paint in a style I did not like to look at. I spent so much time creating things which I had to create but I didn't care about, that art came to feel like a burden to be avoided when possible. Of course that's not the fault of the school. The art department was doing what I as a customer was asking for, and the only thing an art department possibly can do. It was my fault for not paying attention to the whole point of what I was doing there. It was not until late in my Junior year that I realized what had gone wrong and started to do artworks for fun again. Artworks that I liked to look at-- fancy that concept! It's for the best that I earn my income in arranging the office administration of print pieces. I don't want to pollute my love for creativity by being forced to do it in order not to go hungry. Since I know you like the bible, I'll let you look up my art tip from within its pages. It can be found in the book of Revelation, chapter 2, verse 4, New International Version, New American Standard, or King James Version.
