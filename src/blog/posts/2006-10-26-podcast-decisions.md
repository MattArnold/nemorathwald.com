I've received enough good feedback to my last post \[edited to add: I deleted that entry due to making enemies for no good reason\], both in my comments section and through instant messages and email, to seriously consider creating a new podcast. Thank you so much for the support. A built-in seed listenership is the biggest criteria for the decision. I now need to choose a name and some intro music. I'm considering calling it "Suspension Of Belief," as an extension of [the page on my site](http://www.nemorathwald.com/SFandF.htm). Here are some music samples. [Big Ideas Grand Vision](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Music/Vacuum/Vacuum-Big%20Ideas%20Grand%20Vision.mp3); [Power](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Music/Vacuum/cpower.mp3); [I Breathe](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Music/Vacuum/Vacuum%20-%20I%20Breathe.mp3); [Icaros](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Music/Vacuum/cicaros.mp3); by Vacuum I like how [Vacuum's lyrics evoke the unashamed, bald hubris of a cartoon villian.](http://vacuum-music.com/lyrics/) This Swedish Synthpop band makes a suitable soundtrack for ascending into a laboratory tower, pulling the wheel of nature off its hinges, and shattering it over one's knee while lightning streaks from the black clouds. The occasional indulgence in a feeling of caricatured reckless vainglory is a fun, guilty pleasure. (More about the concept of "progress" in a podcast episode.) In any case, I probably couldn't get permission from Vaccuum to use one of these on the podcast, and instrumental music would be better.

I like "Didn't You Mean to Ask About Flowers", with "Mycon Rebirth" as a close second...
