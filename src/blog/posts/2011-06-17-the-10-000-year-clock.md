It's the anniversary of my entry into the cosmos. Spaceship earth has completed its thirty-seventh transit around the sun with me on board. Speaking of anniversaries with the earth, here is a project that I have been watching for several years now: [The 10,000 year clock of the Long Now Foundation](http://www.10000yearclock.net/). This monument is intended to inspire us to think beyond the quarterly business cycle in our decisions. It is a 200-foot-tall clock under a mountain, intended to last more than 10,000 years and measure minutes, hours, days, years, decades, centuries, and millennia. Brian Eno composed a melody generator that will not repeat the same chime for 10,000 years. The clock has been planned for decades, and has an unspecified number of years remaining before its completion. [Here is a more extensive article about the construction process, archival environment, and long-lasting materials.](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/06/the_clock_in_th.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+kklifestream+%28KK+Lifestream%29&utm_content=Google+Reader) Check out the video of the machine that will hew a spiral staircase out of the rock.
