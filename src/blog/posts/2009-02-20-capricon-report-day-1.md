Upon arrival yesterday I immediately volunteered for a few hours, until they ran out of things for me to do. To be reimbursed, I have to fit in 12 hours around running the fan table and Cafe Penguicon. There seem to be more volunteers than available work, which is troubling, but oh well, such problems we should have. This is a well-organized convention. , you need to see the instruction sheet they hand out to volunteers. It is quite nice and possibly instructive for us. The two places of most interest to me personally are Consuite and Gaming Room. After volunteering work ran out, I checked them out. I hovered dangerously close to the Anime room, but did not feel sufficiently lonely to venture in. I went toward Consuite envisioning nachos, soft drinks, and conversation. It was in a Ballroom, and this sucked the feeling out of it. The food looked sparse, but there was exactly what I wanted, so why complain? I got all three of the things I had envisioned! So I consider that success. Then I went to the gaming room a couple of times. It too was in a Ballroom, and had the same problem, with a couple of games appearing to be huddled in the cavernous space of emptiness. The second time I visited, there was someone offering a startup game of [Munchkin Quest](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/munchkinquest/). So I got to play a game! Again this was success. Shadowcat, an MIB from Steve Jackson Games, gave me a [Munchkin Quest promotional coin.](http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/coin/) Thursday is a slow day at Capricon. I think these function spaces will not seem so empty when they fill up to Friday and Saturday levels.

I think Cap's best consuite was 1989 when they had in the hotel's old bar area. Another good one was the old Windycon one in a large suite in the Schaumburg hotel. It was a real social magnet. Decor and coziness are definitely important parts of a good consuite.
