The suggested contribution to the Adobe software fundraising project is $10. I think there are definitely 30 people who have $10 they would want to contribute toward usable, attractive convention websites, maps, ads, program books, and pocket schedule brochures. I am considering starting a [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/) project, but all of the things I can think of to offer to donors as prizes would be things they already expect me to do anyway. I am mulling over that situation.

I will give you $10 if you can find 200 people who will give ME $10 so I can get my medical license. Free medical care! :-p

Since nobody I know would receive medical care from you, that's not really a value proposition.

They would if they asked. Doesn't have to be psychiatric.

Unless you are implying that I'm a crappy doctor, which is not only not nice, but untrue. I seem to recall helping you out with a medical problem at some point in time.....

Why would I imply that you are a crappy doctor? You moved to nowhere, and I see no reason for my social circles to seek out medical care hundreds of miles away.

Well hell, if I had my license, do you think I'd still be here? Silly....:-p

I don't recall how well it worked last time, but if your time permits, kickstarter donation prizes of like, basic caricatures or similar might work. I've never done one, so I might very well be talking out of my ass at the moment, too. That isn't without precedent.
