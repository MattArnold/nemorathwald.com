While behind the blocking software, I accumulated some little thoughts to share with you, so I am giving them all at once as if I had an LJ-Twitter. Yes, I know, I know. I disprefer that practice. But don't worry, it's just this once.

My temp assignment started today and is scheduled to last a month. My plan is to stay in Hazel Park on Tuesday and Thursday nights to cut the commute in half, but return home to take classes on Mondays and Wednesdays.

This is not the first time this company asked the agency to send me back, but last time, they required I bring my own laptop capable of running the design software they use. Mine had nowhere near the power. This time I'm doing my work for them from my laptop. The Wacom tablet is really coming in handy!

I left my car headlights on while I was at work. They sent out a company-wide email, but of course I didn't get it. Fortunately I got a jumpstart.

I just watched an animated special called _The Amazing Screw-On Head_, based on the comic by _Hellboy_ creator Mike Mignola. The particular variety of humor in _TASoH_ makes me think it is like civil-war version of _The Tick_.

I updated [Gnome-Do](http://do.davebsd.com/) on Linux so it would give me a shiny new dock, just like Mac OS X. When I start up Linux, it is supposed to give the message "Type to begin searching." There isn't room in the dock, so it reads "Type to beg."

Glad to hear your day went well, if not being slightly bored... :)
