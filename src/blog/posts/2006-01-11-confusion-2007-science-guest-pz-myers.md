Mere hours after [I blogged about neurobiologist Paul Z. Myers yesterday](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/109297.html), ConFusion picked up on my suggestion and invited him to be their Science Guest of Honor for 2007, and he accepted! Krysta asked me to write an announcement for the e-mail list: Dr. Myers, or PZ as he is known, is author of the popular blog [www.Pharyngula.com](http://www.pharyngula.com/), where he holds forth on science, religion, and the politics of science and religion. Not only does he know the findings of science, he knows why science does its job better than the alternatives, and he is not afraid to name religious extremism when he sees it. Evolution need not be a mystery to anyone. If you ever felt like you needed a firmer handle on the evidence in the creation vs. evolution issue, this is your chance. In his accessable and fiesty style, PZ will take us from the startling marvels of DNA, to the living wonder of the sea. ... It also doesn't hurt that he has a sense of humor, such as in his blog entries about porn for worms!

You can say "Thank you Tammy" for that one. I knew that our initial invites had turned us down, so I forwarded your post to Krysta, since I knew you had impeccably good taste in these matters. :-) (Don't let me down, man!)

A double thank-you, for inviting him and for the compliment!

Now I'm jealous, I might need to go to Confusion.

Cool. Thanks for making the suggestion, Matt. He sounds to be a really great guest. It could be argued, by the way, that suggesting that there even IS a "creation vs. evolution" issue is a rhetorical mis-step that plays into the hands of creationists. Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has not considered the topic. When he hears "creation vs. evolution" he could conclude that these two ideas are competing theories of equal merit. From there it is only a short step to "teach the controversy".

I deliberately chose not to say "controversy." What would you call it? There is not controversy in the scientific community about it, but it definitely is a controversy in the lay population.

You are certainly correct not to say "controversy". I'd say "creationists' misunderstanding of the fact of evolution", or "creationists' campaign against science education". I'd use something besides "versus". Versus could imply controversy.

The reason the religious right are so wound up about creationism (under whatever label) is that what they really care about is preparing everyone for the End of Days. People who don't believe in the Beginning aren't going to care about the End. The _Left Behind_ books may tell a soothing tale about a sinister Romanian, but the evangelicals are afraid that if there aren't enough "good" people in the USA, it will end up on the wrong side of the final battle.
