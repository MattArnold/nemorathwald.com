Those who were amused by [my translation of "I Am A Little Teapot" into Lojban and back into English](-"http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/30583.html") will be amused by Nick Nicholas' [translation of the Sesame Street theme song into Klingon](http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/Klingon/sesame.html). I have long known of Nick through his involvement in the Lojban project, but I also knew he is a veritable polyglot, due to his interest in Klingon and Esperanto as well as several naturally-occurring languages. Following is the English, translated into Klingon and back into English. A Klingon once said to an android, "I don't understand their humor either." Fortunately, that in itself is partly what's so funny!

Sunny day

A day of the daytime star.

Sweepin' the clouds away

On my way
