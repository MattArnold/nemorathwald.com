Comment here with your name and I'll tell you something I adore (or at least mildly like) about you. Afterwards, copy and paste this into your own journal.

All right, Mr Arnold, I'll bite. What factoid about me do you like?

I like your hat.

It's been a long time since we've talked Matt. I think you might enjoy my livejournal. While I do, on occasion, just ramble about my life, most of my posts are movie reviews and my over-analyzing things.

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 25, 2005 7:51 PM

I like your sense of humor.

Hi Matt! I guess I'll put my name up here, if you want a challenge. ;)

I like that you are an art student.

**[ext_199178](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_199178)** on Apr. 25, 2005 7:37 PM

\*pokes you\* You know you wanna do me too!!

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 25, 2005 7:59 PM

One thing I like about you is that you are so interested in talking about deep topics. Aside from all the obvious other things that I like. With butter. ;)

**[ext_199178](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_199178)** on Apr. 26, 2005 4:07 PM

mmmmmmm.... butter.

I like your competence.

**[ext_86358](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_86358)** on Apr. 25, 2005 8:00 PM

Thanks! What a very nice thing to say!

**[ext_362572](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_362572)** on Apr. 25, 2005 8:53 PM

Amuse me. ;-)

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 25, 2005 9:14 PM

Yes, exactly. Your amusement.

---

**[ext_362572](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_362572)** on Apr. 25, 2005 9:16 PM

I am now officially amused. :-)

**[ext_483983](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_483983)** on Apr. 25, 2005 11:52 PM

Me too! Me too!

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 26, 2005 12:39 PM

You are a really good listener.

---

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Apr. 26, 2005 2:59 AM

Okay, I'll bite. What do you like about me?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 27, 2005 4:49 PM

I like that you are a costumer and attend so many SF conventions.

---

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Apr. 28, 2005 2:32 AM

That's right; I keep forgetting that you're also a costumer (despite the fact that we met on a costuming panel). As for attending so many SF conventions, that would be considered a disadvantage by my financial advisor, if I had one. Expenses associated with SF cons and travel are my single biggest category of expense. Thank you for the comment!

**[ext_88358](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_88358)** on Apr. 26, 2005 10:00 PM

I'll put myself here... maybe you have something nice to say about me. \*grin\*

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 27, 2005 7:37 PM

I like that you go to Rennaissance Festivals.

**[ext_2032205](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_2032205)** on Apr. 27, 2005 3:22 PM

OO,OO,, My turn.. Try me out!!

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 27, 2005 7:41 PM

I like the color of your Livejournal.

**[ext_528962](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_528962)** on Apr. 27, 2005 9:22 PM — *Soooo*

What about me, Hmmm?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 28, 2005 2:22 PM — *Re: Soooo*

I will violate the rule of the game and say more than one thing that I like about you. I like your sophisticated style in clothes, your education and intelligence, and your beauty. It sure doesn't hurt that you are so remarkably devoted to me, either, although I would be selfish to demand or expect such a thing. You are always there for me.

---

**[ext_528962](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_528962)** on Apr. 28, 2005 10:41 PM — *Re: Soooo*

My heart doth melt. I love you soooo much. Thanks for those words. They made my day.

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 28, 2005 2:38 PM

I like that I don't have to guess what you're thinking.

---

**[ext_526740](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_526740)** on Apr. 28, 2005 2:43 PM

Well... reading my live journal makes it easier to know :)

I shall bite too. :) ~Karen

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Apr. 29, 2005 12:47 PM

You are one of the most fun people I know.
