![](http://images.boardgamegeek.com/images/pic298577_md.jpg) Who's up for a game of [_Mystery of the Abbey_](http://boardgamegeek.com/game/915)? It's a deduction-based board game with a medieval murder mystery. The object is to figure out which character committed a murder. But its similarity to _Clue_ stops there. I'm thinking we'll play at my place, probably, unless we find somewhere else. Probably some time next week.

That sounds pretty fun, actually. I expect to be free on Friday the 7th. Don't know about weekdays before that. This weekend I'm in Texas. Your post makes it sound a little like you'd rather play someplace other than at your place. I can host if you want. I haveth The Table of Hugeness for playing on.

My place would be great if only there were a more optimal table and chair arrangement. This is a game for four to six players, so the Table of Hugeness would be ideal. Currently the players are me, my friend Hilary who is bringing the game, and you, so I will seek a fourth!

What are you doing for Halloween? Now that there's no party at Jesse's I was thinking about tryi8ng to have some people over, since Chuck will not want to go clubbing.

I'd like to see you! I'll be at Randy and Sheryl's, because they invited me to Brenna's birthday party. They welcome you and Chuck to attend as well, although as it is a party centered around Brenna, it will be milder than usual. You'll hear more about it soon on a filtered post on their blogs.
