This week I downloaded and read [_The Religion War,_](http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook27148.htm) a science fiction novella and the sequel to _God's Debris,_ by Scott Adams, better known for creating the comic strip _Dilbert._ I enjoyed it. Be prepared that it's not a comedy, although it does bring up questions similar to those raised by another famous humorist with the last name of Adams who employed science fiction for the same end in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.](http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/index.html) [_The Religion War_](http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook27148.htm) is about the Avatar, a Sherlock Holmes figure who is a hypnotist and thinks he is immune to delusion, trying to stop a global war between the Christianized western nations and the Islamic Caliphate. The promotional copy says this book will "spark many late night conversations with friends." What I want to know is whether they can remain friends after such conversations. It's remarkable to me however, that no less a cultural influencer than the author of Dilbert recognizes that a deist, an atheist, an agnostic and a pantheist possess nothing important to argue about, whereas people of unquestioned faith have the same essential problem no matter what that faith happens to be.

Yes, I need directions from Westland since that's where the Penguicon meeting is. I don't have the phone number for there either.
