MIT's Technology Review has a video documentary series titled [_"The Impact of Emerging Technologies"_](http://www.techreview.com/player/video/video_compact_leader.aspx?id=44164231&autoplay=true) which is exclusively online. It's really interesting! It covers stem cells; robotic prosthetics with a mind/machine interface; artificial polymer muscle; computer interpretation of body language; nano-scale valves; and more. The video about using lab yeast instead of lab mice for a 50,000-fold decrease in cost and slowness of new drugs showed them using robot laboratory systems. It reminded me of [an article on Edge.org by Kevin Kelly](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kelly06/kelly06_index.html), editor of WIRED Magazine, about using robots, Google, Wikis, "Zillionics" and more, to practice science in the future. Wow.
