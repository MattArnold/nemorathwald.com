Jack Chick's tinfoil-hat evangelical ministry gets progressively farther away from the reality-based community with each new comic-book tract they publish, such as this year's ["Here, Kitty Kitty".](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1032/1032_01.asp?wpc=1032_01.asp&wpp=a) I love how when a child confesses to a schoolteacher they intend to cast a spell on her, somehow the teacher never thinks to correct her student's belief that magic _works_. Instead she launches a hamfisted segue into a lengthy rabbit-trail about the plan of salvation, as if she had never had an opportunity to do so before someone confessed to an alternate superstition. ![](http://www.chick.com/tractimages31777/1032/1032_22.gif) The contrite, apologetic little knife-weilding Satanist children are another bit of unintentional humor.

That strip was so horrible in so many ways, I can't even begin to describe it....

Well I don't know about the rest of you, but I learned smelly people don't get into heaven (Sorry, Pigpen).

![](http://www.chick.com/tractimages79376/1032/1032_14.gif) I've always wondered how that bit worked. Apparently, God assumed his spiny urchin form and shoved Jesus, along with his pal the manta ray, off a cloud.
