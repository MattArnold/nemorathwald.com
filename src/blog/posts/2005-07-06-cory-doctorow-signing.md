Last night we drove down to East Lansing for Cory Doctorow's book signing. It was impossible to get there in time for his reading, but I bought his latest novel [Someone Comes To Town, Someone Leaves Town](http://craphound.com/someone/) and got it signed. Also Cory transferred the digital version from his handheld to mine, in person, which is as close to a signing as it can get in that format without being in the [Second Life online game](http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2005/06/post.html).

hmmm... will you lend _Someone Comes To Town, Someone Leaves Town_to me sometime even though it's signed? I didn't even realize he was around. silly me.

I'll happily do so. I plan to read it on my PDA anyway. The physical artifact is just my way of dropping $26 into Cory's hat. I posted Cory's signing to the Penguicon list but I forgot you weren't on it. Sorry.
