A meme found through : Chances are people you don't even know are being introduced to your journal every day, either randomly or through someone else. In addition to recent entries, people can get to know you better by what you posted in the past. With that in mind post a link to your entries on this day exactly three months ago, six months ago, nine months ago, and a year ago. If there was no entry on that day, link the closest date. I like this meme for giving me another excuse to link to my archives. In particular I'm quite pleased with the quality of the essays that I wrote on or near the 19th of these months. However, it might be worth your time to browse the archive in general, and I would appreciate it. I didn't post anything near the 19th of May this year, so I'll pick one of the close entries which I like the most: [The Nonexistent Liberation Front.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/58453.html) Circa six months ago today, February 20: I am not a pagan, but many of my friends are neopagan, wiccans or shamans and I don't like not understanding something so important to them. So I visited the local mystical ritualist convention "ConVocation" and [reported the experience and my reactions.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/46042.html) Nine months ago today, November 19 2004: I had recently been hired on a permanent basis from temp work. [To My Dear Human Resources and Temp Agent.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/29965.html) One year ago today, August 19 2004: I am extremely proud of this essay. [Genetics and Romance.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/18670.html) Names have been changed to protect the innocent.

Reading your entry to your human resources and temp agent brings to mind the brilliant Terry Gilliam. I remember reading somewhere that he is, like yourself, an advocate of voluntary simplicity and a creative iconoclast. He also has a wonderful talent for liberating money from Hollywood in order to bring his visions to life. It's an admirable philosophy: to do away with the nonsensical consumerism that bogs us down, that keeps us from our creative goals. As a recent cell phone convert, however, I must say that they come in handy. Pre-paid, that's the way to do it.

I was just recently convinced to get a cell phone. I love technology but always considered a mobile to be an indulgent luxury. I wish I had Terry Gilliam's talent for convincing other people to fund my projects. I'm hopeless when it comes to business or finances.

I loved your reaction to Convocation. I've been a couple times. I have a lot of the same thoughts about magic, definitions, approaching ritual from a psychological perspective, etc.
