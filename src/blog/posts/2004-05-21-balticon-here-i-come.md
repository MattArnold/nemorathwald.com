From what I can see of the [Balticon website](http://www.balticon.org/), it looks to be an even bigger and more fabulous science fiction convention than the ones I've been participating in. One of their speakers, who is from this area, was given an extra free admission, and generously offered it to me! I'm hastily planning my road trip to Baltimore Maryland at the last minute. It's a four-day convention from Friday May 28 through Monday May 31. I got the day off on Friday of next week, and the Monday after that is Memorial Day so my office is closed. I don't know what to do about lodging. I can't afford a whole hotel room all to myself. I hope I can avoid having to sleep in my car in the parking garage, which seems very risky in a city renowned for such a high crime rate. At least my food is covered in the membership, because I can eat in consuite. One of the most interesting things about Balticon is their live performances. I hope to create some of my own for Michigan conventions, and toward that end I'll try to learn from them.

Oh, and did I mention the computer room? Got to find out more about that for use at Penguicon.
