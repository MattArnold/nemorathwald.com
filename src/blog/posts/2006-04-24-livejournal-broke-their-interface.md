Sorry for having put such a lot in this entry that wasn't behind a link. Livejournal **broke** their interface today with a new text editor system that takes control away from the user. When I click the "Source" button to directly modify the source, the system changes what I do. It literally wouldn't let me put it behind a link. But now I've figured out how to post source text directly, so I've posted it again with a correct link. I'll keep this entry here to preserve the comments to it.

I was hoping you'd have a picture of the Rocky Horror Muppet Show costumes. Those were just... hysterically funny.

Dang, I wish I'd gotten some espresso ice cream! J. and I have gone to this three (?) times now; I just go to hang in the hotel, don't actually sign up for programming. He said this year was the best time he's had at Penguicon so far.

I've seen you at past Penguicons, but it was nice to finally meet you.

Char served me a beer, she's cool! I think you must have burned 10,000 extra calories, Matt, I saw you everywhere this past weekend.
