The internet has much to say about how superhero comics suck. They're childish, sexist, cliched, and stuck in moribund tradition. Even their reboots just reboot most of the problems. Most people just don't bother reading them; whereas, while I don't read them, I am enough of a nerd to complain about them. Aaron Diaz of the incredible webcomic [Dresden Codak](http://dresdencodak.com/) blogs [his re-design and reboot of the Justice League](http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/10979241054/rebooting-the-justice-league), and gets it right. Very right. If this comic were published, _I would read it._ He also has a bonus comic about [why a cleavage-window in the chest of a woman's costume is bad for crime-fighting](http://dresdencodak.com/images/cleavage.jpg).

his batman is kinda hilarious. that i would totally read. the rest of it...there's hits and misses, i think. there's a justice league reboot called kingdom come. it's been a long while since last i read it, but i do recall liking it.
