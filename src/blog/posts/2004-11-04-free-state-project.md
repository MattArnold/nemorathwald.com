From the website: "[The Free State Project](http://www.freestateproject.org/) is a plan in which 20,000 or more liberty-oriented people will move to New Hampshire, where they may work within the political system to reduce the size and scope of government. The success of the Free State Project would likely entail reductions in burdensome taxation and regulation, reforms in state and local law, an end to federal mandates, and a restoration of constitutional federalism, demonstrating the benefits of liberty to the rest of the nation and the world. The idea behind the Free State Project ... is that by concentrating pro-freedom resources in a single, friendly state we will leverage our influence more effectively while also enjoying immediately the benefits of a freer state culture. "

I love the idea of the Free State Project, it would be fascinating to see a state that tried to enact Libertarian principles. Unfortunately, as nifty as the idea is, there's one problem which will probably keep it from ever working as planned. It seems that over the last few years, large numbers of people from the neighboring states, particularly Massachusetts, have been immigrating into New Hampshire because of the low tax rates. Unfortunately, they bring their voting patterns with them, and have been behind numerous, recent local "pushes" for more government services, and the accompanying higher tax rates. This is also the likely reason that Kerry just became the first Democratic candidate in decades to carry New Hampshire. Sigh....

Interesting to know. I wonder if that demographic numbers 20,000. I take the Presidential outcome in that state with a grain of salt, given the alternative. Yes, Kerry has a well-deserved rep as one of the biggest liberals ever, but I heard Kerry got more votes when he lost than Reagan did when he won. I take it to mean he just got the civil rights vote (read: the anti-Bush vote), not that people want more liberalism.
