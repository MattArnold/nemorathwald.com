Tonight I moved to Royal Oak! I'm just in time to go to [i3Detroit](http://www.i3detroit.com/) and co-host an episode of The Toad Elevating Moment, the show by DJ Blasted Bill (), streaming Wednesdays from 8 to 10 PM on [DementiaRadio.org](http://dementiaradio.org/). Up until this point I co-hosted the Travcast on Tuesday nights, hosted by my roommate in our apartment. But years ago I was a regular co-host for Bill on T.E.M. I'll miss the Travcast, but this is a joyous reunion! T.E.M. will be recorded for a [podcast](http://dementiaradio.org/podcast/?page_id=229) in case you want to catch it later.
