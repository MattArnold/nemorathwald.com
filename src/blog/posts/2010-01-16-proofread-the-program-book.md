I need some of you fine people to check the ConFusion 2010 program book draft for errors. You can download the 9 megabyte PDF file from a link you will find on [this page](

http://drop.io/ConFusion2010proof). This goes to print start-of-business Monday morning, so unfortunately there is only Saturday and Sunday in which to proof. Please email me or comment below to submit your corrections.

Is there going to be a full game schedule? I see that in your program, there are only a few listed compared with the online version.

No one submitted that list for publication, so they're not going in. For all I know, it would be out of date, and it would be my fault for including a list that was not approved for publication.

To clarify, I am currently putting in a document full of games provided by the head of the gaming track. Your event is in there, rest assured. In the first draft I only included the ones the head of programming put into the schedule, which for some reason neglects most of the games. However-- that having been said-- the website still lists games that are not in either of the documents, that I can tell so far.

On page 4, The Dealers Room header...should that be Dealer's Room?

Page 5, under ConFusion Policies, The last paragraph, change "expel and attendee" to "expel an attendee".

Page 6, under the Most Importantly bullet point, "here are a fewless..." needs a space. Same bullet point, all-to-obvious should be all-too-obvious.

Page 7, under BDSM, 9th line. Is there a space in the word "equipment"? It might just be my screen, but it looks like a space... Did you mean to say cat-o-nice-tails? It made me laugh, so if it's meant as sarcasm, awesome, just wanted to point it out in case sarcasm wasn't your intent. A few lines further down it looks like a space is needed. I see roomis, instead of room is... Give me some feedback on the word space issues. I'm beginning to think it's just my monitor at this point. I'll stop pointing them out for now.

I don't do writing, so who knows what was meant. There are some spaces added before am and pm occasionally. That's what created the equi pment problem. It looks like others have caught all the problems with Bant am, and progr am, and so forth. Thanks for the help!

Page 7, right column, under Footwear, you have neeed. Nix an e. You also need to go through and check your page numbers. The symbols you have flanking them are sometimes offset, I noticed this first on page 7, but it's a few more places as well. The symbol is covering text in several places.

Page 8 seems to cut off mid-sentence. "When asked about his output..." nothing follows.

In the SJ Tucker article, second paragraph, does amy Brown need to be capitalized?

Page 13, 2nd paragraph of David Gibbs, starting with "An avid..." It seems like this should start a new paragraph. It's also a seriously long run on sentence. Can this be edited or was it submitted by David?

It can be edited. I was the writer.

**[ext_46539](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_46539)** on Jan. 17, 2010 2:22 AM

american should be American and I think have a space in front of it.

Page 14, AASFA Grant section. "Come present..." needs to be it's own sentence. Is there a description or host for Friday Night Magic? Page 16, Is there a description for the dessert reception? Page 16, Laser show description needs to be bumped up to eliminate the blank space above.
