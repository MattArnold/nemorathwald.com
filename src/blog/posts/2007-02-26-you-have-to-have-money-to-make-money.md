Maybe you know someone who cuts hair? I'm surprized, in your position, you're looking to buy a new chair (surprized you're not waiting until the first paycheck and surprized you're not posting a request on freecycle or checking the secondhand office furniture sales or something.. Pfizer is closing - there's \*got\* to be a glut of office furniture around here somewhere). But maybe I have a different attitude toward these things.

I definitely am waiting until then for that, actually. These are definitely in order of urgency, so clearly that one isn't going to happen. As for secondhand office furniture stores, that's a great idea. The point is, I've got to get one.

I work from home, I sit in my home office chair for 10+ hours every single day. Consumer-grade office furniture wears out really fast. A $30 IKEA chair is just another piece of junk I'm going to have to get rid of in a couple months. Better to shop someplace that sells industrial grade office furniture. Or ask at the new employer; they may have an quality industrial grade chair you can take home. If they want you to work from home they should provide you with furniture anyway, so if you buy something you should at least ask for reimbursement.

And don't feel guilty about asking for reimbursement for home office furniture. If they're not giving you a cubicle at their office, they're saving thousands of dollars in real estate costs, infrastructure, etc; they can afford to provide you with a decent chair.

That sounds like something a college student would say.

I think that is an awesome idea!
