[Marcus Ranum](http://www.ranum.com/) is a security expert in Pennsylvania. (I found out about him in [an article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press](http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/16041202.htm) about [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/)'s Tech Guest of Honor, Bruce Schneier.) In an essay on his site about "[The Farewell Dossier](http://www.ranum.com/security/homeland_security/editorials/Farewell_Dossier/index.html)", Marcus Ranum says:

> Am I becoming a convert to the notion of Information Warfare? I don't think so. You don't need to worry about InfoWar if you're potentially facing a good old-fashioned ass-whupping. When I was a kid I remember I read a science fiction story about a race that was very technologically advanced but were extreme pacifists. They sold weapons to anyone who wanted them - cheap, good, and mighty powerful weapons. Nobody ever attacked them because they assumed that the species actually was holding back all the really good stuff for their own use. Until one day, someone discovered that, in fact, they had been selling all these weapons as a way of population-controlling the other species in the galaxy. So - the other races attacked in force. And every weapon they had promptly blew up.

It should be an established maxim that you can't go two steps from real-life 21st-century technology questions without encountering a science fiction story.

Wow, the essay itself brings up a thoroghly intriguing point. I just hadn't thought of that. If it is even remotely possible that such software hijinx is going on... it's scary as hell.
