Yesterday my friend told me on the phone that when he sees my text messages on the [Lojban](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Learning_Lojban.htm) IRC channel or mailing list, he imagines them spoken by [a hyperactive chipmunk on meth](http://www.illwillpress.com/doc.html)... and suddenly my utterances _cease to baffle and dismay him_. He says other geeks need to meet me in order to be able to execute this audio transformation in their minds. Otherwise, I do not come off as breathlessly offering them the opportunity to get in on something I think is amazing and fun and cool. Rather, I come off as an insufferable buffoon stomping his feet and making inscrutable suggestions that do not compute, as if I were making _demands on them_. I need to interact with hardcore tech geeks more often via phone. (Is it any wonder that I so often bang the drum of "let's have a meeting" in all my volunteer organizations?) Previous to meeting me in person, it was just as difficult for to stomach me as it is to a few of the other hard-core engineering geeks I know. My ideas are based on social considerations, and he advised me that I need to make that clear if I am not to piss of my more logical friends. I should not assume that they're lazy, don't take ownership, or don't want to get onboard a project they are supposedly interested in. The real explanation is that they literally have no idea what I am talking about, and I need to back up and explain. He said that when he would hear my schemes, the behavior of any humans-- actual, flawed, fallable human beings-- never entered his mind at first. It's similar to the reason some socially feral engineers are purist zealots about Libertarianism, Communism, Open Source, etc. Pure ideology works perfectly in an abstract world of perfection where the behaviors of populations actually start making sense. A lot of Lojbanists are attracted to an engineered language for precisely such reasons. That includes yours truly. But I understand the mystique of a fantasy world where America adopts the metric system, keyboards employ the [Dvorak](http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/) layout, everybody uses [Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and humans stop _needing_ to believe in [God](http://www.400monkeys.com/God/). It is a Rapture Of The Nerds, a consummation devoutly to be wished, and it is _not going to happen._ I'm able to simultaneously understand it as a fantasy and still like it. Experience it. Participate in it. As Heinlein would say, "grok it". That intersection is the sweet spot for promoting anything. The embarrassing thing about Marketing is that it is grabbing a mob by the lowest common denominator of its lizard-like hindbrain and shaking it until what you want falls out. In our case, the outcome of using a hive mind of distributed wetware computation on ten million undiscriminating internet users is to get the attention of a few _discriminating_ internet users. To call that counter-intuitive is an understatement, but it works. Art is a magical practice which works on a logic all its own, consisting of doing things that would otherwise be stupid.

My experience is, you don't need to go that far. You do, however, need to step away from my "internal reading voice" (which sounds kinda like that kind old man, reading to children, and pausing carefully at the comas, to give impact) and switch to a fast, enthusiastic, slightly breathless voice (Like the one someone would use to explain how cool, amazing, and otherwise mindblowing this new TV show / movie / cell phone / book is.) I had the great advantage of meeting you in meatspace before I interacted with you online. . . and I habitually picture you, with your enthusiastic, and slightly (Insert word here, somewhere between zealot, manic, missionary, and mischevious. . . I know no such word, but it is needed here), anyway, with that look on your face, and it all makes sense. You speak the things you see the way a marketing brochure reads. You rarely mention the pinch points, or the annoyances. You always expound on the good, and usefull, and petential. . . And YOU know (And \*I\* know) that the average adherant will only care about, or use, ten or twenty percent of that amazingness. . . .But you have to tell them about all of it, so they can find the piece of that amazingness that motivates them. The rest of us habitually only talk about the thing as it pertains to us :P. I see it as a great skill you have, and picture some day when you are hired as a salesman for a progressive, high quality, open source using, linux enabler. . . And you will use that missionary zeal to convert thousands of companies, and make that company millions of dollars. Leash your innate enthusiasm for progressive, society altering technology, with a company living the ideals you believe in. . . And you will love your job, and they will love you. Just my 2 drachma about the way you interact, think, speak, write.

You will enjoy the flash animation I just linked to, from the words "hyperactive squirrel on meth".

By the way, if I haven't mentioned this recently, you are a truly good friend to have. At very least for me. Your enthusiasm is infectious, and makes me a better me. . . And I like that in friends :P.

A particular issue we discussed was a change Matt wanted to make to the home page of lojban.org (which I run). I told him that my first response to the change was dumbstruck horror. He suggested reasons I might have been horrified, but they all had to do with people. I hadn't thought about people at all. My thoughts weren't things like "Will this get people to the site? What kind of people?" but instead were "Will this make the computer unhappy?". To put it another, "Is this a grotesque hack?". The answer in this case was clearly "yes", and that's enough for my geek brain, hence horror. However, I have the (apparently very rare amongs geeks) ability to say "Yes, but he's better at PR than you. Just shut up and do what he says.", so I did. The interesting part here is only that how the change would relate to the people viewing it _never crossed my mind_, and this fact was a surprise to Matt. -Robin
