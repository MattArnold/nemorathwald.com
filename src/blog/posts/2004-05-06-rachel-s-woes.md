Despite Rachel's valiant attempts to make ends meet with her receptionist / data entry job, it now looks like she'll have to move back to her parents in Alabama after all. Her roommate has been in the hospital for the past few months with more incurable fatal illnesses than I can keep track of. So, since the sick lady no longer lives in the apartment, she has decided Rachel is no longer necessary as a live-in caretaker, and is going to have to charge her rent. Unless cheap living arrangements are found or she gets a better-paying job in the immediate future, this will a very sad time for Rachel.

Hey Matt. Perhaps now might not be the best time to ask but will the two of you be up for another BBQ/pot luck this Sat? Same time/place as before. As for a place for rent, perhaps I might be able to help you out in that department. I'll start looking around. Catch you later, drop me a line if you can. Talk to you then.

I'm going to be out of town Saturday, but thanks for the invite and offer!

OK, yesterday morning Rachel faxed a bunch of resumes and at 8:00 pm the same day, one of them called her to set up an interview for Monday. Maybe that miracle will happen after all.
