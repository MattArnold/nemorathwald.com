came over and helped me finish up my car repair so it would start. Nothing worked until he tapped on the starter with his wrench. Now we're going out to a car parts retailer to pick up struts for 's car. It has been a rough week, neither of us with working vehicles, but I'm glad to say I have transportation now, and just in time too.

Unfortunately, [there aren't enough funds in Ypsilanti to pay for the Ann Arbor Transit Authority's bus services](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ypsilanti_city_council_opts_no.html), so that might be reduced before the year is out.
