[Jonathan Coulton wrote a great song lauding Benoit Mandelbrot and his famous fractal.](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/mandelbrot-set) A discussion on the Penguicon mailing list of inviting Coulton to Penguicon (answer: we really should!) branched into a discussion of what kind of music counts as "filk". Of course Penguicon does not consider such categories when creating the Music track. We only consider what musicians our attendees like, and J.C. is as firmly within that category as anyone on the planet. Anyway, during the filk discussion said: "I consider filk to be music based on a fandom. A song about Something Positive is filk. A song about, say, the Mandlebrot Set is not." What? A denial of Mandelbrot fandom! This cannot be allowed to stand. So I made this as proof. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000abttz)

I have heard filk which was purely technical in nature. There's one I recall, which I sadly do not have in any form, which was about integrating systems on the S-100 bus.

Dave and I got into this discussion in the car yesterday when I played him a song that he didn't see really fit the definition of "filk" as he knew it. I said "Filk is music played by filkers!" And he said "And I suppose next you'll say that filkers are people who play filk?" And I said "yup." And he said "I suppose that's about as clear a definition as I'm liable to get." :P

Awesome artwork :-) If we get Coulton, we must have mass production of said image on T-shirts. :-D

Why does he look like Dave Thomas? You're making me hungry. Fractal burgers, hmmmmm.

I knew this picture looked familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it until somebody else said it. It \*does\* look like Dave. Now I want a "triple with cheese".
