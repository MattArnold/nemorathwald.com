While looking at satellite imagery on Google Maps, I discovered something so big that you don't even notice it at the ground level. Go to maps.google.com, click on southeast Michigan in the map of America, and zoom in on Macomb County. There is a "zoom" control that looks like a ladder on the upper left, under the video game directional pad. You can drag the map to scroll it. OK, now go to I696, viewing right between Hoover and Schoenherr. Magnification should be the second rung from the top of the zoom ladder. The quickest way is to enter in the directions "Hoover Road, Warren, MI" to "Schoenherr Road, Warren, MI", taking care not to mis-spell Schoenherr. In the upper right of the screen you see Map - Satellite New! Click Satellite. Tell me, what the heck is that path of desolation? I ASK YOU. Incriminating evidence that some shadowy corporation headquartered a mile south of 696 between Hoover and Schoenner created a Godzilla-like creature and unleashed it on a horrified populace. You can follow it on satellite imagery all the way up to 28 Mile... and then the satellite photos end. The tracks disappear into the foresty deep.

I believe that "path of desolation" is a high voltage power line right-of-way. You can tell because periodically you can see the shadows of the power line towers cast on the ground, from the southeast to northwest, indicating these photos were taken during the morning hours. But the lines themselves, and the bars that make up the tower structures, are below the resolution of the satelite photo. A mile south of I696 appears to be a power distribution substation. The lines appear to be coming in from the north to that distribution center, as opposed to being from Fermi II, which is to the SE near Monroe. Sorry to burst your bubble of belief with something scientific.....

I've often driven past it on Masonic on the way to my parents' house who live right next to it, so I've seen the towers. Godzilla's path has a silver lining. Somebody in the gubben'mnt should get an award for adapting this crisis to the public good. Talk about getting lemons and making lemonade!

I am in awe of Google maps. Did you know that they have gone global? Just now I was checking out Paris, the Giza plateau, the Forbidden City in Beijing... Simply awesome

Actually, the tracks don't stop, they just fall victim to low-resolution photographs. There's no telling how far North the beast ravaged...

I work right by there, it's just power lines. But I am having some kind of operator error when I try to use the google map. I click on SE Mich like you said, and nothing happens... (??)

I must be really stupid because when I finally got the damn thing to zoom in, it would only zoom in on Indiana, so I had to scroll up to Michigan, and I see are streets, like a normal map. No path of destruction.
