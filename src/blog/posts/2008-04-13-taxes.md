Is anybody willing to fill out my taxes for me? Maybe you could consider it a service to Penguicon or something? I have four or five different W2s. I am much too busy for this.

If you're certain that you won't have to owe taxes, i.e. you're getting money back then you don't have to meet the April deadline. And there are several online tax places that will help you do your taxes for free. TaxAct.com comes to mind.

**If you're certain that you won't have to owe taxes, i.e. you're getting money back then you don't have to meet the April deadline.** I don't think that's exactly right. Here's how I understand it: _If you owe money,_ you can file for an extension, which is automatically granted. However, you have to estimate the amount of taxes you owe, and if you don't send a check for that amount, you can get charged penalties (which are a percentage of what you owe based on how long it takes you to pay the whole thing -- not huge, but they can add up). _If you do not owe money,_ you still have to file for the extension, but there aren't going to be any penalties.

They say you have to file an extension. However, if you're getting a refund, I've never seen any kind of penalty for omitting the extension.

I have no earthly clue.

Chuck says he'll do it. I also wanted to point out that if you can't get this done in time, all you have to do is fill out the extension form, which I'm pretty sure they have online now, and mail that by the tax deadline.

If you do want help or want someone to look over it, I'm happy to do it. I just don't have much time other than today, and you do kinda live on the other side of the world from here. :) I recommend using TaxCut, rather than TaxAct. (I cannot tell you how many miscalculations TaxAct has made. Something like 2313 minus 1039 is 542, for example.) Although a lot of websites will let you file the federal for free. (And then charge for the state.) Don't forget to include your rent on the Michigan return. If you want to check to see if you're getting a refund, and you want to scan them in, or give me the numbers from boxes 1, 2, 16, & 17 from the W-2s, I can do the math real quick. Then I can help you do it this weekend.
