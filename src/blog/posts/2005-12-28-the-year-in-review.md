In a few days I will set down my goals for 2006. Last year at this time [I blogged about my goals for 2005](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/35649.html). It's now time to review. _\-- Start learning Python._ Status: Unstarted and abandoned. Even if I had learned a programming language, I would never put it to any use. I will not pursue it. _\-- Dedicate more worthwhile hardware to open-source, and install a build of Linux on it which I can actually get software for._ Status: Complete. _\-- Reduce my involvement in running conventions to a responsible and realistic level that will not make me dislike what I love most._ Status: Indeterminate. I think this goal was accomplished, but I have mixed feelings about the desirability of this accomplishment. Should I sacrifice more, or should I learn to let go? There's so much need, and it's so important to me. But I don't know what more I can do without running myself and others into the ground. _\-- Learn the next 1,500 words in Lojban and move consistently to at least the sixth stage of expertise [as defined here](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=vocabulary+expertise+stages)._ Status: Close. This goal aimed a little too high for the time allotted. I'm very proud of having memorized more than 1,000 words out of the 1,300 root words and the 500 particles. I have conversational fluency in the chat room, because unlike spoken words, typed words hold still long enough to translate them in my head. _\-- Explore using open-source desktop publishing software._ Status: Complete. _\-- Somehow afford a cellular phone._ Status: Complete. _\-- Get more alone time._ Status: Complete.

How interesting. I'm taking up Python now, and may actually finish a whole book on programming.

Excellent! I'll keep that in mind for when Penguicon needs something programmed in Python. Now that's what I call distribution of labor!
