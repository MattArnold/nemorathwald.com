FestiFools is a street parade of giant puppets that normally takes place near April Fool's Day in Ann Arbor. But they're doing it again this Saturday, this time in Grand Rapids! It is a competition with many other art exhibits for a $45,000 in prize money called [ArtPrize](http://www.artprize.org/). They put out the call for volunteers to operate the puppets. They will provide vans from Ann Arbor at 2 PM, arriving back at 11 PM, with box lunches. I took them up on it and am very excited! The puppeteers have normally included many inhibited college students who are too concerned with their appearances to operate the puppets with any flair. From what I observed, most of them seemed to participate only because they want to date an art major who begged them to help out. I expect the quality of this weekend's performance might be more enthusiastic because it is likely to include only those who want to be there. Do any of you want to come along?

That looks like so much fun! Sadly, I'll be busy on Saturday. Someday I will participate!

"Want to..." yes... sigh.
