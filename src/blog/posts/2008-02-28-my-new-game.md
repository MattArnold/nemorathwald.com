After playtesting my new game with many of my friends, all of whom have enjoyed it, it's clear that I'm onto something here. Now I seek a publisher. ![](http://lh3.google.com/matt.mattarn/R8c2kWk2mhI/AAAAAAAACiU/BqfL6Ec2ZvA/s400/Photo_022508_001.jpg)![](http://lh3.google.com/matt.mattarn/R8c2kWk2miI/AAAAAAAACic/8pqvDsQRy1w/s400/Photo_022508_002.jpg)![](http://lh4.google.com/matt.mattarn/R8c2kmk2mjI/AAAAAAAACik/e5WAYqPAf1w/s400/Photo_022508_003.jpg)![](http://lh4.google.com/matt.mattarn/R8c2kmk2mkI/AAAAAAAACis/D5IAITheqpA/s400/Photo_022508_004.jpg)

Next step: try it on some people who aren't your friends, like the Ann Arbor Gaming Guild or something. They're "AAGG" on yahoogroups, and they meet the second Tuesday and fourth Wednesday (I was there last night with the card game I'm playtesting). I can't stress enough how important it is to get a game tested by as many different gamers as possible.

Looks fun. But I agree that testing it with a bunch of other people is a good idea. Maybe have a set for Penguicon to demo? I have a bunch of cardstock I could donate. ~A~

I would love to do that. I am in need of the cardstock! When and where can I get it? :)

I am on Spring Break starting next week Thursday. It's half-sheets of card stock (8x5.5, I believe). I got it for free from school. There's the option of coming to Lansing, since I don't think Marshal will be driving towards Ann Arbor anytime soon. ~A~

Looks interesting. But is it a good idea to post pictures of an uncopyrighted concept before you shop it around?

I'm not worried about it.
