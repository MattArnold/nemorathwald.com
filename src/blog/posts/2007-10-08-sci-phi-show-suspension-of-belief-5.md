On [today's installment of my Suspension Of Belief segment on The Sci Phi Show](http://thesciphishow.com/?p=169), I give a reading of ""Enough is Enough, A Thinking Apeâ€™s Critique of Trans-Simianism". With permission from Dresden Kodak, it's taken from his blog entry attached to the bottom of [this comic](http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_040.html).
