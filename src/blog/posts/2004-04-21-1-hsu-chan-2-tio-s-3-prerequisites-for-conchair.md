I carpooled to Ann Arbor for "Tuesdays at Tio's" yesterday. Unfortunately I got the 9 switched upside down in my memory and we arrived at 6:30 pm. So I said, "as long as I'm in Ann Arbor I'm gonna go to Underworld." I got the latest issue of [_Hsu and Chan, Game Designers_](http://www.ape-law.com/evilmonkey/hsuchan.htm), which is the only print comic I buy. When we finally met our friends, we had a great time... but it's a little late at night for people who have to drive back to Roseville and Auburn Hills. I listened in fascination to Dan Peisach about cryonics, Raine hinted at the possibility of getting together a GURPS Transhuman Space campaign, and I suggested to Steve and Tracy that to prevent errors it would make sense for I, as the program book publisher, to be part of the programming team and be present for as much of it as possible. Then they cheerfully uttered threats involving me serving as conchair someday. It's a funny joke, but I'm starting to hear it so often I'm getting nervous. Ask me again -- -- after I've served in every concom department. -- when I have a house to meet in. -- when I can read my own posts to my combative warzone of a flaming messageboard (www.theelectricmonk.net) and still, somehow, come across with the impression that I possess the _surpassing graciousness_ exemplified by the conchairs I've worked with. -- when I know everybody who's anybody in fandom, well enough to twist their arms. All of the above prerequisites are scheduled to come to pass at ten past never on the eleventy-first of Octember.
