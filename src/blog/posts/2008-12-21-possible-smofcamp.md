I am thinking about possibly starting a four-times-a-year SMOFcamp for all of fandom and hackerdom to work, brainstorm, and connect using the [Open Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) method. First step in planning is hard numbers on what it would cost. I would like to rent a hall, and seek a good location equidistant between Washtenaw County and Macomb County, for a reasonable price. Can you give me recommendations?
