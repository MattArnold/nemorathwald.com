Apologies to Nicholas Gurewitch of "Perry Bible Fellowhip" for this edit. [His comic strip](http://www.pbfcomics.com/?cid=PBF210-Wishing_Well.gif#198) ended one panel too soon. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000aecd1) _Perry Bible Fellowhip all comics are property of Nicholas Gurewitch 2001-2007. Used with permission._ Happy Birthday, Rachel. I love you.

Your version is, indeed, better than Nicholas Gurewitch's.
