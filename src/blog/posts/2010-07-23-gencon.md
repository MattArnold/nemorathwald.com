It looks like I get to go to [GenCon Indy](http://www.gencon.com/2010/indy/default.aspx)! I will be working as a demonstrator for Mayfair, setting up and teaching their games in the exhibit hall. Wednesday, August 5, through Sunday, August 8. I haven't been there in about five or six years!

Woot! We should get together for lunch or dinner or whatever your schedule allows.

Hey, glad to hear you're making it. I usually pop in the Mayfair room now and again so I'll likely see you there!
