So today I'm doing my twice-annual side job, operating a camera for holiday services. The pastor asks the children in the congregation to name some things that people can enjoy at Christmas. The first kid says "Hanukkah!"

Now that is funny. Have a good Christmas.

From a Jewish perspective, not so funny. Ignorance abounds. I had a boss in the Navy that asked me "Hanukkah is the Jewish way of celebrating Christmas, right?"

I'm with you. First of all, Hanukkah was over like 2 or 3 weeks ago. Second, if it didn't come somewhere near Christmas I bet most Jews wouldn't even know it existed, given its actual level of importance. Still, it makes a good history lesson, and an excellent point about actual diversity.

If this "out of the mouths of babes" comment gets to tweak the noses of humorless Christians who expect others to care about their traditions, _and_ humorless Jews, who expect others to care about their traditions, then I get to laugh twice. It's a twofer!

Not necessarily care. Just have a clue, and not be so ignorant as to call Hanukkah the Jewish christmas.

Because everyone should understand your particular beliefs? I think not. I can't read every book of fiction out there so i can't expect that of a child.

There is a large difference between not knowing something and providing misinformation. I don't think it's an unreasonable request that, if you're going to talk about something, that you know what you're talking about. Not knowing what Hanukkah is is fine. You are, theoretically, capable of learning. Deliberate ignorance as you seem to want, however, is stupidity. There is also a large difference between "understanding my beliefs" and being able to describe something in a single \*correct\* sentence. Was the child in the original post corrected? I don't know, but I'm guessing not. Was the navy officer a child? Are you a child?
