Do you care about the future of fandom in southeast Michigan? Then you should attend SMOFcamp in Ann Arbor on Saturday, August 22. SMOF stands for "Secret Masters of Fandom". Held in a space provided by the new relaxacon [ConStruct](http://constructacon.org/), with a grant from the Penguicon board of directors, SMOFcamp is a fandom leadership and recruitment summit. ConFusion, ConClave, U\*Con, and all other regional geek-related events are invited to participate. It is an [Open-Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) meeting: a schedule of breakout sessions which is designed by the attendees when they show up, by affixing large post-its to a bare wall. Anyone may post a topic to the wall. Unlike a business meeting, you don't have to wait while someone has the floor. If you aren't learning or contributing, you are expected to go to a different session. Just a few suggested sessions: "Feasibility studies on your proposal for an AASFA cool stuff grant or Penguicon board grant" "How to incorporate" "How to become a 501c3 charity: Is it worth the paperwork?" "New tech tutorial days to precede Penguicon" "Web applications for convention scheduling" "Starting a group to do consistent marketing for multiple conventions" "Enforcing convention etiquette culture: How to tell someone they are misbehaving at a convention, without making an ugly scene which is worse than the problem" "How to negotiate with hotels" "Race at conventions: What is the situation really? What causes that? Is there anything we can do? Should we?" YOU bring the topics and projects. Food is provided by ConStruct. Admission cost for ConStruct is not yet determined, but will be affordable for anyone $30, with hotel rooms $70 after tax. Limited financial assistance available to promising participants, with shown cause of need. Please RSVP to matt.mattarn@gmail.com.

Hrm... I'm kinda interested in talking my registration software and/or seeing what the interest is. Is this a reasonable 'topic'?

The reg rate is $30 for the weekend. Also, hotel rate is $70 after tax (I don't recall the pre-tax rate, I just know it works out to $70.?? after tax) This sounds awesome, for the record.

Well thank you for saying so! I'm eager to look over the map of the facilities and find out what dimensions the SMOFcamp space will be.
