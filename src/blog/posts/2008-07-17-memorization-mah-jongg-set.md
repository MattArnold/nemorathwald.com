I made this board in the mid-nineties out of air-drying paperclay and painted it with guache. I painted wooden tiles with Japanese hiragana and katakana characters, and invented a Mah-Jongg variant to memorize them. It was a much less boring way to do flashcards. If you click the image and go to my web gallery, then click the magnifying glass button to the upper right of the photo, you can see lots of texture and detail.

I love this! Thank you for showing it! I would love to play real Mah jonng some day... I had a thought, as this looks a bit like stained and painted plaster...what if you made a silicon mold and poured plaster or resin into it to make more boards? Hmmm... yay! games

As I've gotten to know what can be done with ceramic, that was my thought.
