Zompist.com has [a humorous set of notes](http://www.zompist.com/crib.html) that an artificial intelligence might need in order to pass [the Turing Test.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) For example: _Clever questioners will ask about your feelings. Safe responses: 1. I'm anxious. 2. I'm depressed. 3. I'm hungry. Bad responses: 1. I'm itchy. 2. I'm righteously indignant. 3. Constipation's gone!_
