Who among you is not using the Mozilla Firefox web browser yet? And who among those who are not using it would be willing to be my "Firefox Friend"? It does not mean you have to switch to Firefox. It means I'll let you know why I think you should. Then, if you download Firefox before September 15, our names will be added to Firefox 2. Checkout [the Firefox Day website](http://www.worldfirefoxday.com/en/).

lol, since I've been meaning to download it anyway, but never seem to care enough to do so, I'm most likely a sure thing. Perhaps you were hoping for a challenge, though.... So, is this some sort of scheme on the part of Firefox? I find it quite amusing, but I'm not sure why.
