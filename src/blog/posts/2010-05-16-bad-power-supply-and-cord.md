Confirmed. The problem was not a bad laptop battery. The problem was that the power supply/cord doesn't transmit power from the outlet to the laptop. has the same model laptop and brought it to the gaming party last night. Her cable charged up my laptop's battery. It wasn't fried-- just depleted.

Sounds like a not-too-expensive fix
