I left [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/) laden with gifts. Some were gag gifts, and others were obviously chosen based on a keen knowledge of my interests. I'll leave it to you to be curious as to which is which. But both kinds leave me feeling very loved and appreciated. Here are some of them. [![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/ShMcBG1vRLI/AAAAAAAAGgk/qtAqzT-ifRE/s400/penguicongifts.jpg)](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oysaZDmdexPaLg1PrbKRNg?feat=embedwebsite) A. [Taiji](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31926), a fun and simple two-player board game created with wood-burning fabrication, given to me by David Whitcher. B. A limited-run pendant/keychain, 6 of 99 made by Alex "metalsmith" and given to me by . C. "[In The Land of Invented Languages](http://inthelandofinventedlanguages.com/)", featuring extensive sections about [Lojban](http://lojban.org), from the author, [Arika Okrent](http://arikaokrent.com/). D. A foam-board mounted [M.C. Escher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) print from . E. A plush martial-artist penguin, the mascot of [Guru Labs](gurulabs.com), given by . F. Romulan Ale, given to me by . G. High-heeled platform shoes, delivered by Orvan the Ox, and a tiger, during opening ceremonies, supplied by and . It came with a letter saying it was an enticement to get me to start cross-dressing, and wear shoes like this more often! I am happy to both amuse and arouse all of you. ;) Good grief, it hurts though. Thanks to each of you! I apologize to anyone who gave me a gift that I neglected to include in the group photo-- it is possible I have yet to dig it out of one of the boxes and bags I brought home.
