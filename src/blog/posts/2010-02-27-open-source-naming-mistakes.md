In one of the worst naming choices for open-source software since "[The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/)", the GNOME project is considering naming their innovative new user interface element "[the TaskPooper](http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/KuHpfD8dNRc/task-pooper-could-revolutionize-gnome-desktop.ars)". It's a chronologically-organized "content drop-zone" for task management. Whether it manages tasks performed by the user or the computer is unspecified. This sounds like the Windows Taskbar at the bottom of the screen, but one which prioritizes the latest things you've done.\* And excretes the old ones. Or something. It's difficult to explain without seeing it. A name should be evocative (for instance, don't say "Xgl" or "Compiz", say "Desktop Effects") but not scatological. Skeezy names prevent mass adoption almost as much as unpronouncability. \* Probably according to "freecency"\*, if I had to guess. \*\* frequency + recency = relevance. Usually.
