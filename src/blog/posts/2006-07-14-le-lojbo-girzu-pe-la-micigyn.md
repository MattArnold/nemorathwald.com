I've known for years, but didn't expect her to show up for the meeting of my local [Lojban](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Why_Learning_Lojban.htm) group this week! Who would have thought that she speaks so many words of Tolkien's Elvish (aka Quenya) and can get up to the whiteboard to scribble formulas for the Monty Hall problem? What fun. The regulars Neil, Jen, Bruce and Sean all managed to attend simultaneously. It was the largest gathering we've had all at once. Let me know if any of you feel an interest, by the way. I made frozen coffee drinks for us all, this time containing coffee-flavored ice cream. Jen and I reported on the status of the Lojban fridge poetry magnet prototype, and the plan for the Logical Language Group Inc., of which I am a board member, to [have a company print several hundred batches](http://fridgedoor.com/55todoliswor.html) so we can sell them on the site. We talked about which film to translate, out of the candidates whose filmmakers have offered them to us. I would still like to make a machinima of [Fossil Games](http://www.nemorathwald.com/purdom_fossil_games.htm) as a long-term goal, but currently [Love and Plutonium](http://www.loveandplutonium.com/) looks like a front-runner. We also translated something which came out as {mi na kufra le nu do vecnu le mi zargu}. If you know what that means, you're laughing right now.
