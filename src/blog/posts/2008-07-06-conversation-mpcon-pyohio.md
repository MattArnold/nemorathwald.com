[ConVersation](http://con-versation.com/), [MPCon](http://www.mpcon.org/), and [PyOhio](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyOhio) are all on the same weekend. I'll go to ConVersation and leave briefly to have a meeting with the MPCon organizers and their sponsors. Even though I'm doing the program book for PyOhio, Columbus is too far away to catch either of the other events.
