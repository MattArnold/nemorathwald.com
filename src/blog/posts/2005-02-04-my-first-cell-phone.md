I have a cell phone! (248) 787-7436. It's T-Mobile, so if you have T-Mobile and a certain feature in your options, you can call me for free. Please try my home phone first between 6:00 and 9:00pm so that I can jealously guard my minutes, because it's 40 cents a minute after I deplete them. Also, I have AOL Instant Messenger on my phone! I'm browsing through my options on [Phonespell.](http://www.phonespell.org/) Should I use the mnemonic "AI-USURP-GENE" or "A-GURUS-RID-6"? Both of them represent me quite well. In July I gained broadband internet for the first time, which at least I don't have to pay for, but now I also have a cell phone. Will wonders never cease...

Do you know if you're going to be able to make it tonight? I think you were a maybe for Friday, so I was trying to get a last minute count to tell the restaurant. Thanks. :)

I'm still trying to figure out what my phone number spells. Nothing really nice has struck me yet. I just have OIL in the middle. :)
