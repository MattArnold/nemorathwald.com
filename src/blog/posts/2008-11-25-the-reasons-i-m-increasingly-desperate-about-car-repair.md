For those who don't know, Jen's mom is not allowed to know I exist. She is visiting Wednesday of this week through Monday of next week, when I can return to the apartment in Ypsilanti. Chuck and Rachel have kindly offered to let me crash on their couch in Utica. Then on Thanksgiving I am going to my parents' house for a few hours. Then to Randy and Sheryl's in Livonia on Friday for Bitchgiving, and the concom meeting on Saturday is also at their home. All in all, it's an incredibly bad time for my car not to start. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/SSuDXvRqowI/AAAAAAAAF9E/z0xfKd8dN8I/s800/trip.png)

Matt, where do your parents live? What city?

They live in Warren, off of Schoenner, between 13 1/2 Mile (Masonic) and 14 Mile.

Where is the car now? Who has looked at it? Do you know what's wrong with it?

At home. Me and Jen. It is as you see in [my previous LJ entry](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/265639.html).

If it's the clamps at the end of the wires that go to the battery, they're pretty easy to cut off and replace, so you should be able to get your car back in service.

you can get to my house on the #4 if you still need places to crash that require no car. :) good luck fixing it though, winter sucks without wheels. :(

Thanks, I really appreciate it. Fortunately I have found multiple rides for all of the stops on my itinerary! I also recently discovered Bus route #4, and it is a wondrous thing.
