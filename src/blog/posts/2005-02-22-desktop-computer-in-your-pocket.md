SWEET LARD AND HEAVENLY BUTTER. [The oqo handheld computer](http://www.oqo.com/) is a complete 1Ghz desktop system, with a slide-out thumb keyboard, running Windows, measuring less than five inches across. The pen works with a chip that senses a disturbance as the pen's coiled magnet enters a magnetic field just in front of the screen. A button on the pen switches polarity of the magnet, which the computer interprets as a mouse click. This pen is forty times more accurate than most touch screens, requires no batteries, and is sensitive to more levels of pressure than just "on" and "off." The screen automatically brightens and dims according to ambient conditions. If you drop the device, the hard drive detects that and parks the heads before impact. It has WiFi, BlueTooth, FireWire, USB, and my heart. If I had nineteen hundred dollars, it would be worth every penny. Screw a new car, who needs it. The good news? If the past decades are any lesson we'll all be able to afford one some day.

Oooh shiny! Actually I wouldn't consider $1900 all that expensive for this, a lot more than _I_ could afford but not expensive.

I agree. If it works as well as they say, that sounds like a fair market price. For people who are in a position to spend that kind of money...

Ohdamnsexywhoa. I have only said that about my favorite managers Palm Treo 650 before... which could play MP3's, had bluetooth and firewire and internet and acted as a cellphone too. Oooo. :) I'll wait until the prices go down for the Oqo \*grins\* I want it!!! I also want the skirt I won last night like rightnow, but that's another story. ~Karen
