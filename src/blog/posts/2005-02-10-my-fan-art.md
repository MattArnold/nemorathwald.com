Lots of people do fan art. I do fan art of Penguicon. Don't expect to see this art on the new website, or for that matter, to see it ever again. But it took a long time and I want somebody to see it. The following art is personal and totally unofficial. Do not interpret anything about it as a statement about Penguicon looking like a flyer for a rave party, or as a statement about your favorite operating system. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0004rkyp) Credit is to to the transhumanist artist and collaborative SF author from Sweden, Anders Sandberg, for the fractal in the background of this image. [More of his breathtaking computer-generated art can be found here.](http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/ray.html)

Nobody has announced a new website, aren't you being a bit premature?

Premature in what? Mentioning it? It's no secret.

Sir, I beg to differ. If it's not mentioned on the website, or in Penguicon-General mailing list, then as far as the general public (of which I am now a member) is concerned, yes, it is a secret. BTW, if you give me a PDF hotel layout modified for Penguicon 3.0, I'll get it printed ANSI D sized (or bigger!).

With sincere apologies, I don't understand. I'm talking about it on my LJ, which is kind of the sort of activity one does not do when nobody is supposed to know about it. But then, I don't understand a lot of things that are nonetheless true and I suspect this is one of them. I guess I was using "secret" to mean "something we want to keep people from finding out about," which it's not, and you use "secret" to mean "something nobody else happens to have been told about in the eighteen hours or so since it was decided in my basement around mouthfuls of pizza and Mountain Dew." I will get out an announcement ASAP.

I gathered that had been decided when Bill told me over the phone that Penguicon was aggresivly investigating switching webhosts. I agree with the reasons, I agree with the direction. When you get the chance, ask Bill if he wants me to transfer the Penguicon.org domain account (currently held under my name at NetworkSolutions) to him, or someone else, or keep it for right now. The account will need to be edited when the webhosting provider is switched.

I notice some of the images on 's site are created by [the Electric Sheep program](http://electricsheep.org/) running on his computer. That's cool. I run that on my Windows and my Mac, and as soon as I get Linux working it will be contributing all of that box's unused cycles as well. Also, how fondly I recall using [Mojo World,](http://www.pandromeda.com/) which he also has images from. Fun stuff.
