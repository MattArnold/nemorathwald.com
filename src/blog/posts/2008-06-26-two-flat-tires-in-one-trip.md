I had two different tires blow out on the same trip! For the first one I used my spare. For the second one, R saw her way clear to kindly drive out at quarter after 11 PM and pick me up from the shoulder of 696 at Lahser. The car is still there, while I am stranded at home. Tomorrow I need to figure out how to get transportation to fetch the rims, take them to a tire place, get new tires put on them, and take them back out to the car.

Craptastic! This all happened last night when you left? Ick, so sorry! Well, now you know you have two local friends! And I work from home and my schedule is totally flexible, so seriously, if you need an emergency ride somewhere...do not hesitate so ask. Its no biggie. Hope your day gets better...

NOOOO! That is terrible. I too am volunteering to give you a ride to do whatever you need to get your car going again. Don't hesitate to call me.
