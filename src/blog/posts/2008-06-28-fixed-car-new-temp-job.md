It took two days and two tire stores, but the car is now set right. came out and picked me up to help with "moving day" on Thursday, and on the way back and forth we stopped at my car and the tire store. There wasn't time to get both tires replaced that day, and then she left for the trip and won't be back 'til Monday. On Friday met me at the tire store local to us, to drive me to the first day at my new temp assignment. It was cool to get to know her. Oddly, the new client doesn't have any work for me at the moment, because it was a slow day. I'm filling in for someone who is taking time off. They don't design ads, they design (get this) automobile user manuals. I've been looking at the manuals, and they are terrific usability pieces. They use icons in the text, and callout paragraphs with pointer lines to diagrammatic illustrations. For some reason, they haven't bothered setting up style sheets in their documents. I got to listen to the boss try to teach the department supervisors how to escalate confrontation with those to whom they have given tasks that went undone. Not directly applicable to volunteers, but interesting. My first impression is that I feel like I fit in with this department. They're hip. I've mentioned that it's only a week, but there is a chance that this client will have more work before long that needs someone.
