Uh-oh: I just found out something about the saying which we have on the [Penguicon](http://wiki.penguicon.org/PenguiCon) [concom](http://wiki.penguicon.org/ConCom), in which I am going to "beat them with the Wiki Stick" until they put their operational reports and plans on [EncycloPenguicon](http://wiki.penguicon.org/). I now can literally do so. Wiki Stix are [actually for sale.](http://www.abc123kindergarten.com/hollimanpicturepage45.html) They're pipe cleaners covered in wax. Watch out, !

Hrm. I think, perhaps, I will choose not to dwell in terror. (:

Have you collected your royalties for the first shipment yet?

You should see if there is room in the budget for these. And, I think you should start with other people... like those who don't even have up information about THEIR OWN NAMES on the wiki. I mean, who better to write an article about someone than THEMSELF? And I'd like to take a minute to point out my [funny wiki entry](http://wiki.penguicon.org/HotelLiaison). And of course, [me](http://wiki.penguicon.org/BrendanDurrett).

I don't like to actually pressure anyone about it unless it's something urgent to our current situation; like the event list is right now. A lot of concom/staff don't need to have entries about themselves if they don't want to, and a lot of pages won't need to be created for another few months. Your funny wiki entry made me laugh when you first posted it, and your photo is a good one.
