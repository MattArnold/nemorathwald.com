[Protospiel](http://protospiel.org/) is this weekend! It's a playtesting convention for board and card game designers, and playtesters who feel they can offer feedback that is specific and useful. You get a sheet to record how many games by others you have playtested. When you have enough of them, you get your own game playtested. I submitted Ingeniators and Pantropia, both of which I have refined for years. It's at the Clarion Hotel on Jackson in Ann Arbor, 9:00 Friday morning to 7:00 PM Sunday around the clock. Admission $45, or one day for $20. Scouts from Mayfair, Steve Jackson Games, Elfinwerks, Minion Games, and North Star Games will be present.
