I'm off work today on medical leave, and working on the [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/) program book. I use my [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/) desktop computer for web browsing, instant messages, music-- everything but games and graphic design software. I dropped the folder "My Music" into Totem Music Player so that it would queue up all the music files in my entire collection to play for me randomly while I lie in bed recuperating and working on the program book on a laptop. I liked one song in particular and went to find it in my filesystem. It was nowhere to be found by browsing, but turned up with the "Find File" feature: [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/00084gwr)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/00084gwr) I right clicked it and chose "Open Containing Folder": [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/00087gqb)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/00087gqb) It's contained in home: Music: Soundtracks: Ghost In The Shell. So I clicked the Soundtracks folder. [![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000869aw)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000869aw) The Ghost In The Shell folder is not visible in the folder that the computer says it's in. Why?

Apparently, the two tilde's throw off Gnome. Any filename with two tilde's disappears from Nautilus's view. I don't know why. I'd like tell you to just rename the folder and it will show up as long as there isn't two tilde's in the name, but you'll have to drop down to a command line to do so.

I went through this process again and when it was showing the contents of the invisible folder, I right-clicked into the window and selected "preferences." It had a field for renaming the folder. I deleted the tildes and it now shows up fine! Thanks!

AHA! Goto the View menu and select Show Hidden Files, and then switch to List view and back again. A simple Refresh won't work.

Penguicon program book? Say, somebody mentioned to me that my real name is used on the website programming page (in the dancing for geeks). Can you switch me back to Rennie in the book (and maybe even the website)? I'm fine with my last name being there, but most everybody in "con world" knows me as Rennie. Also, I hope you heal quickly and easily. (: (:

Sure thing. You got that request in under the wire; I'm sending it to the printer tonight. It'll take a while for me to get around to editing the website, but it's on my to-do list. Or somebody can register for the Wiki and do it.

Awesome, I'm so glad you posted and triggered my memory! Thanks much.
