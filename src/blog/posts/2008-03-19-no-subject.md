The magical elves that inhabit the wiring of my car's ignition have decided today that I have appeased them. According to the landlady, the ceiling elves were supposed to visit today, but if they did, they left no sign.

If the ceiling elves fail to appear, you can attract them by placing your rent in an escrow account, rather than the landlord's mailbox (where the elves expect it to be). Be sure to get the incantation correct; it sometimes summons eviction elves instead, and you'll want the papers to dispel them with . . .

I've been trying, with all my might, to resist the use of the phrase "made of awesome", but I cannot, for you are correct. It is made of awesome. (And truth)
