Today I gathered up a sealed PodDisc CD mailer box, a roll of pre-printed address labels, a customs form label, three Amazon.com shipping receipt printouts, and my financial aid refund check. I went out to the car and deposited the contents of my hands onto the passenger seat. I drove to the post office with the window down in place of air conditioning. There, I took three copies of the hardcover The Complete Lojban Language out of a box in my back seat. I picked up the contents of the passenger seat and went inside. I took flat-rate Priority Mail cardboard envelopes from the rack and into each I inserted a book and an Amazon.com shipping receipt. I affixed the pre-printed address labels and threw the backing away. Giving the clerk the customs form, I shipped the PodDisc.com CD mailer box and the three books. There was no check on the passenger seat of my car. I reviewed every step I just described. Did I just ship my next few months' funds to Germany with a book? Did I drop it in the post office or in the trash with the label backings? Did it blow out the driver's side window right in front of me? I checked the post office, but it wasn't there. When I arrived back home, I stepped out of my car and found my check in front of my feet, on the other side of the parking lot from where I departed. It was somewhat the worse for wear, full of pebbles from when it was run over, but the carbon copy and receipt layers protected it. The good news was that my tax refund arrived while I was gone, so I could deposit them both at once.
