From time to time I melt plasticine in a pot on a hot plate with an electric mixer, either to mix colors, or to get a consistent color from discarded crumbs. ElfinWorks is hiring me to do some illustrations for a card game, and I decided to sculpt and photograph them instead of paint them this time, so I got out my equipment. But my hot plate and mixer are so old and busted, they barely operate any more. The plasticene isn't melting, and the mixer grinds and whirs. They were second-hand even all those years ago. Anybody got such devices to spare?

I have an electric hot plate you can use.
