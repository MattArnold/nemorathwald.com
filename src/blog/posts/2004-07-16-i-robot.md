Scientists today detected a slight wobble in the earth's orbit. It was determined to be caused by Isaac Asimov **spinning in his grave.** I was seriously annoyed when I saw the trailer to _I, Robot_ and realized it was yet another modernity-phobic action movie. The book _I, Robot_ was a thoughtfully philosophical collection of detective stories about the communion of mindkind. Just like with Paul Verhoeven's film of Heinlein's _Starship Troopers,_ the director of the film [probably never read the book.](http://www.kentaurus.com/troopers.htm#translation)

Have you seen it yet? [Howard's](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/) seen it. You should read [his comments](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/letters/d/20040716.html) on the movie.

Overall, I like it. I'm still thinking about it. And most of all, I need to re-read the book.
