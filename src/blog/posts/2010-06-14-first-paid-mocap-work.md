It brings a smile to my face when I think that I'm getting paid to do motion capture work. I'm helping out a student from the mocap performer class. Unlike a tech, it's not a performer's job to clean their own data, so the instructors pointed him my way. It's at a lawn-mowing pay grade, but it feels like the first dollar taped over a cash register.
