On the suggestion of , I used [RKill](http://www.technibble.com/rkill-repair-tool-of-the-week/) to disable the malware processes on my laptop, but they just started back up again immediately. I suspect it was done by a rootkit-- perched, spiderlike, at the heart of all authority in my system. This means I will have to erase my hard drive and start over.

Consider switching to Linux? Or better yet use a Linux LiveCD transferred to a USB drive. That way disinfecting the system, if it's ever needed, would be as easy as pushing the Reset button.

I already run Linux, but I must run Windows to run the software I want to use.
