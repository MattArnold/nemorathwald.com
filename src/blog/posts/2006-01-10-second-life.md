Sweet lard and heavenly butter. You are not going to believe this. I can hardly believe it myself. As you can see from the image behind the lj-cut, I am actually drinking tea at a tea party in a Neo-Victorian finishing school, and I am actually enjoying it. It doesn't hurt that my tea-drinking compatriots are Steampunks, it's a scene out of Neil Stephenson's science fiction novel _The Diamond Age_, and this is a well-attended discussion group about the cutting edge of desktop minifacturing appliances. Aha, well _that_ is impossible to resist. Now that [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) is free, its online world sucked me in instantly. My handle in the game is Nemo Benmergui-- use that handle to look me up if you join the game. They have inducted me into the groups "Thinkers," "Singularity," and a Jules-Verne-themed group, "Deep Divers". ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0007gbq0) That's me in the lower left. The tables and shelves are lined with books which, when you click them, pop up the entire text of a science fiction tome by the likes of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. ![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/0007fzq2) I think I got my avatar to look reasonably similar to me.

Hmm. Maybe I want to play Second Life and not WoW... (And yes, I think the avatar looks reasonably similar to your person.)

I am SO glad that my computer won't play that game. I would never get anything done around here, ever again!
