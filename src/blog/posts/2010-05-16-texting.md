I got a cheaper phone provider, with the same phone number. My new handset has a keyboard! I am entering the world of texting. It is now a workable communication medium for me. Here is [my first twitpic](http://twitpic.com/1oeiq6), of my new Dominion storage box. I sleeved all the cards, printed, cut and painted the index tabs yesterday.

Wow, mine doesn't even have a keyboard yet! Nice! I'll probably be getting a new phone near the end of the year, though. \*crossing my fingers for the Nexus One\*

How do you manage it with a 9-digit keypad? Also, can a Flip cam take a still photo?

I have just gotten really fast at it with much practice. The T9 predictive text input is pretty good, too. And yes, the Flip can take stills, but you have to do it with the software. You basically load the video into FlipShare and then there's an option to grab a still from any video you take.

Wait, is dominion a "collectible" card game a la Magic? I hadn't gathered that it was.

No, it's very different. There do not exist any Dominion booster packs full of random cards. If you want a particular card, you can just buy the specific expansion in which a full set (ten or twelve copies) of that card is included. Another difference is that up to six people play the game if only one person buys only one Dominion base set. CCG collectors need multiple boxes like this to store the massive number of cards they did _not_ want. I only need one. I called it a collection because I bought the base set and all three expansions.

The reason I need a storage solution is that I take my games everywhere. The boxes in which Dominion is sold contain so much air that my catalog case can only fit two of them, and nothing else. With the box in this photo, I can also fit a bag of lead fishing tackle and a pair of barbells. But I don't fish and I don't lift weights, so I just include my laptop and give my arm a break.
