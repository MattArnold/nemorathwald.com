Replacing auto suspension is not trivial, but easier than I ever anticipated. Some cars can use what are called "quick struts", a shock absorber that is pre-assembled so that you don't have to use a special compression tool. That's what 's car uses. Removal and installation are straightforward. We hit some obstacles on the first one, but it was just a matter of time.
