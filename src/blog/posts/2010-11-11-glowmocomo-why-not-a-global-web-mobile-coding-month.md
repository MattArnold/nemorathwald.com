[NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/whatisnano), (National Novel Writing Month), for those who don't know, is November. Thousands of participants commit to write a 50,000 word novel in thirty days, cranking out a set number of words per day. If you make it, you "win". You're not supposed to care whether the novel is good. The purpose for most of them is to train themselves for the discipline of creative output on a tough deadline, in an environment of mutual support. Why not a GloWMoCoMo? Global Web/Mobile Coding Month.

Kinda sounds like a recipe for a design that will haunt you for years.

Oh my god, you wouldn't actually use it! Just like you wouldn't ask anyone to read a NaNoWriMo novel.

Look around you, at a lot of the web pages and apps out there. I think GloWMoCoMo would be redundant.
