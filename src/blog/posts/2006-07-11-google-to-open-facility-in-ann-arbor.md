AP Wire: [Google plans to open Ann Arbor-area facility, hire 1,000](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/15012375.htm) ... to handle AdWords, their pay-per-click advertising system. It would not be surprising if this were also related to Google's operation to digitize the library of the University of Michigan and make it searchable.

I also wonder if Proquest (they do publication archiving) fits into their plans if at all?

Heh... I used to work in the digitizing project for about a month. I hope the new place they're working in doesn't have airborne stuff that makes people sick.

Who did you apply through? Kelly?

Nope, Adecco. If you're interested in applying for it, ask for MDP (Michigan Digitization Project).

This is very exciting news. I hope it leads to more jobs, the right kind of jobs, coming to Michigan. Maybe we can also look forward to finally getting some high-res satellite shots of A2 on Google Maps.

Well, since the job I'm applying for there is "scanner technician", I'd guess it probably will have something to do with scanning the U of M library...

The 'scanner technician' job posts have been there for months so it has nothing to do with the recent news. There was also a post for a supervisor, which we found very amusing and came to the conclusion that the project is getting even bigger. There's ALOT of books though... A very interesting side note: the law library is scanning in its own books independently of the MDP project, however, at a much slower pace of course.

My question is How do I apply, and how do I get Chris DiBona to recommend me?
