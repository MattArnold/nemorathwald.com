Today has been designated ["Boobquake"](http://www.blaghag.com/2010/04/in-name-of-science-i-offer-my-boobs.html), in which the public can test the hypothesis of an Iranian cleric, Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi, that immodest dress causes earthquakes. Women, if you wish to participate in the experiment, please wear your most revealing low-cut shirt today. Dan Savage has declared May 20, 2010 the first annual ["Everybody Draw Mohammed Day."](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/04/22/everybody-draw-mohammed-day) I drew mine last night and will post it on May 20. Even if all you can do is a stick figure labeled 'Mohammed', get your drawing ready! Oppose death threats with cartoons!

Too bad "Boobquake" doesn't coincide with the weekend, because both garb and cosplay tend to be more revealing than anything I'd wear while teaching middle school. ;)
