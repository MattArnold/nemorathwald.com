Do you have a copy of Windows XP Pro lying around at home? I'm writing it here because I mean to ask you when you get home, but I know I'll forget. Thanks.

No, I don't. Sorry.

It's midnight, everyone has left. And it turns out I do know myself... I had forgotten. :) Thanks anyway. You missed a fun night and a really awful movie. The movie's in the DVD player if you want it. (And I mean that literally.)

There was a moment in my management class last term where a guy was going on about how he didn't get how those TV evangelists could get anyone to send them money. My teacher said that he (the student) must have made his saving through. I chimed in: "Against charisma anyway." Three or four of my classmates were in utter hysterics while the rest looked on blankly. This comic evokes that moment very nicely.

Make that "saving throw". Arrgh.
