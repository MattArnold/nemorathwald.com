Ever since I revealed to R that there is infinite anime on the web for free, the hours of 5:30 to 11 have been filled with it non-stop. This generates sound right here at the computer desk. I don't want to record podcasts with a background in Escaflowne. Therefore, all my contributions that I owe to podcasts, including my own podcast, have stopped dead. Their plaintive cries call out to me, inspiring both guilt and desire. I wouldn't wish to separate her from Naruto, so I must think of some creative solution. The good thing is that I have three computers side by side, so I can always do work on one screen while Vash the Stampede frolics on the other. The bad thing is that the headphone cord doesn't reach from the computer to the couch. Perhaps the cheapest way is to buy wireless headphones? Any ideas?

Ack! Seperate her from the Naruto before it's too late! Keep her from that sad fate of being a Narutard. :) Other than that... since I can't seperate myself from the anime and hate using headphones to watch tv, I don't have any productive suggestions.

Yes... but is she obsessed with Naruto? Fan who love Naruto to the point of watching it continuously and/or being obsessed over it and/or cosplaying as a Naruto character are called Narutards. :)

aw crap, she is a self-admitted Narutard- she has 26 unaired "Timeskip" epsiodes, 26 music fanvideos, and 15 regular episodes from the first series, all in subtitles. As well as a bunch of raw eps. All on her laptop, with more to come.

Either wireless headphones or (cheaper) a headphone extension cord from Radio Shack.

Or, you know, you could work out a time to do that and compromise.

That is pretty funny, actually. Would a head-phone extender, while not as cool as wireless, be cheaper? (Like a cable that connects head phones to computer.)

Personally, you need to get her into a 12-step program to treat the addiction. ;-) In the meantime, the cheap solution is an extension cord. The next cheapest is probably the wireless headphones, and third cheapest is a wireless router, so the computer can move, too, into another room.

I'd say headphone extension cord. 6 feet ought to do it. I got my most recent at Wallmart, but I'm sure Radio Shack has them too. If you can find one that doesn't have gold plated connectors and costs twice as much for no appreciable increase in sound quality. I think my old 6 foot one was in the $10-20 range or so. But I agree that perhaps 4:30 straight hours of anime is probably not healthy. I'd hazard a guess that she has other thing that she wants to do / ought to do. I know I easily fall into that kind of trap when watching YouTube or listening to a good audio book. And I tend to regret it later.

I think abc has wireless headphones for 19.95 or so.
