[Protospiel](http://protospiel.org/) advises game designers that they will be lucky to get to playtest more than one of their games during the weekend. Fortunately, attendance this year was high enough (easily more than 60 at its peak) that there were playtesters waiting around for something to play. They were eager to play both of my games, which ran three or four times each! Both games attracted tremendous interest. I consider both of them publishable and ready. I spent the rest of the time playtesting the games of other designers until I was exhausted. Highlights were: - _Rhome_ by Brett Myers (Elfinworks or Mayfair, I can't remember which), an area control game. - _Eight Siders_ by Jonathan Leistiko (Steve Jackson Games), a dice game. - _Tahiti_ by David Whitcher, a pick-up-and-transport game, against which I would be proud to win or lose in the Rio Grande Game Design Competition. My current fear is not that I won't be published, but that the publisher may completely re-theme, rename, and strip all my artwork and flavor text out of my games. In my opinion, all I lack is capital and marketing. In the worst-case unlikely scenario of interference, I may promote the game with a browser-based version and turn to [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) to raise funds.
