If you're going to be at ConClave this weekend, you can catch my presentation and demo on podcasting: how to subscribe and listen to podcasts, and the bare-bones minimalistic free-of-cost method to create your own. It will be on Sunday at 11:30 AM in Ballroom 6. Until then, you'll mostly see me working in the Consuite. I look forward to seeing you there!

Just stopped in to chime in regarding the Podcasting Presentation at ConClave, I thought it was a good beginner’s primer to podcasting. Demonstration of the applications was a nice touch. I think this was a good presentation and whether it is always a conscious effort it becomes an excellent public relations tool for Penguicon at conventions where community and sharing can be so important. It just adds another tool to the toolbox! Keep up the good work! I will keep you posted on the efforts of my friend’s son podcasting adventures!
