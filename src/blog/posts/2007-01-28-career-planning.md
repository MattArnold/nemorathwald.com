In the Psychology Blog, Jeremy Dean writes about ["Why Career Planning Is Time Wasted".](http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/01/why-career-planning-is-time-wasted.php) I'm not sure I'd go as far as the title, since daydreaming about what would like, in anything, at least possesses the "utility" of fun. Regarding career, I'd say the old saw works as well here as in any other area of planning: hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But if you have a plan and you admit that it might not work out as well as you think, don't let anyone accuse you of pessimism-- just so long as you intend to try it and find out.

"No plan ever survives contact with the enemy." :-) Life is a many-branching path. The best one can do is determine what one does best - or what one doesn't mind doing that other people \*do\* mind doing - and then be willing to be flexible. You should still pick a target to aim for. If you wind up somewhere else, that could be good too.
