I've started translating the insidiously cynical and online web comic [Perry Bible Fellowship](http://cheston.com/pbf/archive.html) into [Lojban](http://wiki.lojban.org/). This is one of those web comics which is cute and cruel at the same time. Below the cut are several samples. ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/pbflojban/PBF058BC_kensa_tcica.jpg) deception type of head ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/pbflojban/PBF059BC_bogygreku_xampre.jpg) Expression of blame. Rhetorical question: true or false: (you know (the fact (how much is the price of (funny-type-of-person) school)))? ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/pbflojban/PBF056BC_gerku_pacna.jpg) Release of emotion: desire! The speaker can (but has not-- undemonstrated potential) sell the speaker's spirit for the price: dog. ![](http://www.nemorathwald.com/pbflojban/PBF079BC_pacycrida_patfu.jpg) Oh father. Please look under my bed at one or more evil fairies (or elves, sprites, kobolds, imps, orcs, or devils). Don't be nervous. Go to sleep.

I love PBF! It's absolutely hilarious (most of the time), and the only webcomic that I read. Gurewitch is brilliant. Here are two of my favorites: ![](http://cheston.com/pbf/PBF011ADHammerScrewed.jpg) ![](http://cheston.com/pbf/PBF023BCRaftFriends.jpg)

It appears that you speak Lojban as well! Please help me complete this project by translating some more of the comics. I will then replace the text in the comic strips. OK?
