I'm scheduling a get-together soon for those who want to work on making puppets, sets and props for the new marionette play "The Trouble With Death Traps", adapted from the short story by Marjorie James. The current invitee list includes me, Randle Ball, Allison Anderson, and Karen Corbeil. Let me know if you're interested in helping and learning interesting artistic techniques, so that I can try to arrange the session around your schedule. Puppet builders will get the chance to look at the booklets published by the eccentric genius, master puppeteer, and inventor of the term "graphic design", William Addision Dwiggins (WAD). There will be six puppets. If we have time and develop sufficient automation, we might innovate a group of three or four additional puppets hanging from one control mechanism, a nameless entourage who are all operated in tandem. The visual style will be inspired somewhere between Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" ([costume photo gallery](http://golosangeles.about.com/od/losangelesmuseums/ig/FIDM-Oscar-Exhibit-Gallery/Costumes-from-Apocalypto.htm)) and Disney's "[The Emperor's New Groove"](http://craftymonkie.com/caps/newgroove/index.html). We'll just need to be careful with flamboyant headdresses and capes, that they aren't built in such a way as to restrict the strings.

Here is the list of props.

The email address I have for you doesn't seem to be working. Would you mail me?
