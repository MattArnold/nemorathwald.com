Does anyone want to carpool from the Detroit/AnnArbor area? EDITED TO ADD: Oops, I should have said Saturday, not Friday.

Nuts. Against Limey's Halloween party. Hopefully I'll be able to hit one in December, now that I'm finally on the appropriate LJ group to get the announcements! :)

No carpool for me, since I'm already in Lansing, but I intend to be at the SMOS dinner.
