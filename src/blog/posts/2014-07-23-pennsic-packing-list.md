I have been told that I need the following things for my first trip to [Pennsic](http://www.pennsicwar.org/penn43/) in a week and a half (August 1-4). Part 1- Things I still need to obtain include: • Tent • Air mattress • Tarp • Tent floor: picnic blankets/rugs (probably unnecessary) • Snacks: meat sticks, beef jerky, granola bars • Comfortable shoes for lots of walking • Feast gear (I don't even know what this means) • Knife • Water bottle • Flash light • Dirty laundry hamper (optional) Things I do not need to obtain include: • Clothes: Underwear, all tunics/SCA clothes, socks • Belt pouch, belt • Wallet and keys • Phone and charger • Aloe and sunscreen • Toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, hair comb, shampoo, conditioner, razor, tweezers, nail clipper, towels • Camp chair

Further comments on your "obtain" list: - Tent: Yes. - Air mattress: Whatever you want to sleep on. Could be a cot, or a mattress pad, or a couple sleeping bags on the ground... whatever you need. - Tarp: Yes, for under the tent. Or ask whomever you're borrowing the tent from what they do. - Tent floor: Probably unnecessary for you. Lots of us like to line the bottom of our tent with rugs to keep the dirt/dust down and to make our living quarters more comfortable. For three days, you'll be quite fine without this. - Snacks: There is plenty of food to buy at Pennsic, including snacks. It depends on how much you want to spend and whether you have very specific snacks you'd like to have with you. - Comfortable shoes: You don't have these? What about your high tops? - Feast gear: Typically, a plate, bowl, mug, and eating utensils (fork, spoon, knife). Not entirely necessary. At the food court, you won't need them. If you're eating at friends' campfires, they might have an extra set of dishes for you to borrow. - Knife: Not necessary. I find having one to be useful, but if you ever do need a knife at Pennsic, there will be someone near you who will let you borrow one. - Water bottle: I have some extras you can borrow. - Flash light: I have some extras you can borrow. - Dirty laundry hamper: Again, optional. You'll be fine just throwing your clothes into a corner of your tent for three days. So, really, the main things you need to obtain are the tent, tarp, and whatever sleeping arrangement you need (don't forget pillows, sheets and blankets! Pennsic evenings are sometimes really hot, and sometimes freezing).

A few other camping supply possibilities not specific to Pennsic: - Pillow - Air pump (inflating a mattress w/o one takes forever) - Bug spray - First aid kit - Tea/Coffee/Juice Boxes - Instant oatmeal - GORP - I like to cook, so I bring camp cookware and other ingredients. At the least, it's nice to have something to boil water in.
