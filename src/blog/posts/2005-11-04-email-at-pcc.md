[This is from a thread on PCCboard](http://www.pccboard.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4316) about e-mail access being restored after the internet had been banned from campus for years; and the sneaky means with which a tech-savvy student can gain free speech as if he is a Chinese dissident. A consensus was reached on this thread that PCC is the perfect training ground for secret agents. A choice quote: shawshank: "oh goody, goody -- can I download songs on my iPod, too. can I? can I?" : "absolutely. you just can't use headphones to listen to them."

Did you attend Pensacola Christian College? From their Wikipedia entry, the place looks pretty extreme. White glove inspection in the residence halls? Scary! These discussion board members might just want to reconsider their choice of educational institution if they are going to go to all that trouble.

... which I read as "it's a wonder we aren't both abnormal." :)

_"it's a wonder we aren't both abnormal."_ I don't recall seeing anyone that said you were not. Do you WANT to be normal?

Aha, if it's only one of us, I didn't say which was which, did I? I am most distinctly not normal. I voluntarily learned a language which is not only dead, it was never alive. My ex-wife lives with me. I deliberately don't have kids. I think death and taxes are engineering problems. I attend events where we occasionally dress [like this.](http://www.nemorathwald.com/Penguicon_2003.htm) And to top it all off, if Pensacola Christian College is a cult, that makes me an ex-cultist, who now has membership in the [Church of Virus](http://www.churchofvirus.com), Pastafarians, and other joke churches. I could go on, but the list is too long to belabor. All in all, I am acutely aware that I am one of the most unusual people I know.
