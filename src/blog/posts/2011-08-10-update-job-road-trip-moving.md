While at GenCon in Indianapolis, a friend of mine set up an impromptu job interview for me. It's with a company who works remotely-- the whole team works in different states, programming medical information systems. So it doesn't matter where I live. They said they definitely want to bring me on to do the front-end programming of the design and user interface. They'll give me a freelance contract job first, and if that works out, make me an employee. (I feel much more comfortable with a "try before you buy" arrangement.) It was difficult to come up with exact compensation numbers when they haven't worked out the specifics of the first task they want to contract me for, but they assured me it was enough to live on all by itself. Still, I would like a 9-to-5 job on top of that. If anyone knows of anything, please send it along. It doesn't have to be in web design/development, print design, or anything uniquely suited to me. Unskilled labor or general office work would be fine. Now that I finished going back to school, I need to pay that down. Today I got a request, from the same friend who set me up with that job interview, to go on a road trip with him. He has a job interview in Massachusetts and another in North Carolina, and needs someone to take shifts driving. I like road trips. We leave about eight hours from now, because that's just how I roll, and the trip will take through the rest of this week. He agreed to drop me in Richmond to visit . I have not seen her in years, which was unacceptable to me. :) She has a tendency to suddenly materialize behind me when I least expect it. I considered doing that, but decided to make plans instead. Then, next week, I move to Whitmore Lake using my sister's pickup truck. If you can help, which days next week would you be available? I would bring a mattress and bed spring (I haven't had a frame in years), a computer desk which is easily disassembled, a set of steel utility wall shelves, two trunks, a few modular plastic tub drawers, a small folding table, a desk chair, a little newspaper stand, a hamper, a column of milk crates, and I think four boxes. My suitcase of games lives in my car, so I don't count that. I have perfected moving. I'll also get rid of a lot of stuff. To start with, does anyone want the free swag GenCon gave me? It's "RIFT" for the PC, and a "Jace Beleren" Magic: The Gathering deck. I'll miss this room and never forget it. Good times, good times.

Seriously? That's what... two months short of two years? It seems longer.
