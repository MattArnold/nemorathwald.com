I received several texts, emails and voice mails today about the [Dare to Share Challenge](http://projectmessiah.com/x6/shop.html). You get the Basic version of the messiahStudio5 animation suite for $10 (regularly $499), or the Pro version for $40 (regularly $1195). Given the cost of Autodesk Maya is even more extravagant than messiahStudio's un-discounted cost, naturally I couldn't pass it up. The catch is that if they don't reach their financial goal, instead of sending the licenses, they'll refund everybody's money. The project is almost halfway there! We should all chip in, get our licenses, and start having 3D animation classes at [i3Detroit](http://i3detroit.com/)!

It seems a little odd that the page doesn't say what the financial goal is, how much has been collected so far, or how long this offer is open for.
