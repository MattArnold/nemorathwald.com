Heavy heart today. I'm getting blamed at work for things that are outside of my control. Rachel is defending the Religious Establishment and criticizing me for fighting back. She may as well hold me down while they throw their punches. It's typical of some of my friends to do this but I am resigned to it. It makes me value those who support me all the more. I don't feel in the mood to go to my discussion group tonight, I just want to take a chill pill and not have anything else spoil my day.

I did not want to make you feel down. I was just trying to debate tecnique. I am not defending the religious establishment in any way. I agree with everything you said. I thing you are a wonderful, charming, brilliant young man who happens to have a lot of pent up anger. I'm in no way trying to get you down or hold you down. I hope your day gets better. Don't let work get to you. You are very much appreciated. :-)

OK, sorry to throw a pity party. I'm I'm just drained of my resolve right now-- or my pent-up anger, whatever. It's like Braveheart unmasking the guy he's fighting and it's his own king... he just laid down and let them take him away. (Not to claim that I'm Braveheart or something.) When it reaches my own friends, it's time for pack it in and turn to another subject for now.

I'd offer to take it all away but I can't. It's just another hurdle. If you want I can really get you riled up and we can learn things about the laws that really set our mind to spinning. Have a good night either way. And you know if you take to many chill pills it get's a little cold out. \*hugs\* \*loves\*

Oh my, last night at MOFO was a doozy when we learned about that girl who got pregnant through rape and the courts let the rapist in prison deny her permission to get an abortion or put it up for adoption. I would get furious about that except that I am not temperamentally inclined to get furious about anything right now. \*resumes staring at wall\*

...some days, it just feels as though the target sign is over the left side of the chest
