You are fighting a Blob of Vagueness.

My friend Timo from Germany is coding Lojban Quest in Python as a web-based game. [My design document.](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dg5wbmjw_12fjmvcm) [Timo's github site for LojbanQuest source code in Python.](http://wiki.github.com/timo/lojbanquest) The first time someone implemented my LojbanQuest design, some years ago, it was written in Scheme Lisp, under [mooix](http://mooix.net/), where Linux serves as a Multi-User Dungeon. It was sort of web accessible, if you did enough research. I admire that in the same way that I admire programming in assembly directly on a hard disc with a refrigerator magnet. Speaking of Scheme Lisp, now needs to get familiar with it for a Programming Languages class. So I will go along on that ride, at least tonight. Java, Python/Ruby, and now Lisp. At ConFusion, told me all I need to get the most diversity is to add Haskell. [Comparing programming languages to literary genres](http://yuki-onna.livejournal.com/426022.html), I wonder which one Haskell would be? Diversity is not actually my aim. I will pick Python and Ruby, because my aim is to build web applications as easily as possible. If I do learn a Lisp-like language, it will be for scripting new games for the desktop application Zillions of Games. It's a universal engine for abstract board games. To make a new game, you script the rules in Zillions Rules Format. [The ZRF page of Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillions_of_Games) shows the source code for Tic Tac Toe and describes ZRF as "Lisp like".
