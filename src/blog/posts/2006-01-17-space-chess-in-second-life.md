While in [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) playing [Tringo](http://www.tinypirate.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Tringo) (a combination of tetris and bingo), [Bejewelled spinoffs](http://www.tinypirate.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=PrimAttack), and [Settlers](http://www.tinypirate.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The%20Settlers%20of%20Second%20Life), I realized Second Life might finally allow me to implement the [ideas I had for space chess with computer graphic mediation](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/66434.html). Why not? Others are using SL to recreate [a teddy-bear version of Warhammer 30,000](http://secondlife.blogs.com/nwn/2005/08/sandbox_game.html). :) However, once I built the 3-D model, I would have to pay someone to program the script for it in Second Life's proprietary scripting language. (For more background, you might like to read my Beginner's Guide To Space Chess.)
