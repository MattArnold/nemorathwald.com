Has anybody else been watching Colonial House on PBS? I ordinarily don't watch much TV but this has enthralled me. One of the participants is a Baptist minister from Waco, Texas who the show decided would be the governor of the colony. Other colonists include a liberal theology professor and his feminist wife, a British guy who uses a lot of foul language (and wears a scarlet "P" for profanity all the time), and a married couple of atheists. This group has to live together in psychologically stressful conditions of isolation, disease, near-starvation and abject squalor for four months. Spoilers... The governor and his family went home when the daughter's fiance died in a car crash, and the colony fell apart without his leadership. When he came back (alone), the governor got tired of giving everybody scarlet letters and punishments for skipping church, and declared he would no longer try to enforce it because they'll never get any work done. He agreed with one of the feminists that she doesn't have to wear her head covering as long as she will trade it for a permanent scarlet "M" for modesty. Then his family rejoined him and they had a very tearful reunion. One man cracked up and left the project on foot for two days just to go to a pub where they gave him a free beer and chips. Another guy came out as gay during a church service! I can hardly wait for the concluding episodes which air on PBS on Monday and Tuesday.

Right now, my plans are to hang out with a girl I know, partaking in cappucinos and philosophy. What do you say?
