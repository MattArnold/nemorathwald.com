It is with great pride and excitement that I announce my new position with Escape Artists, Inc., creator of [Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org/), [Pseudopod](http://pseudopod.org/), and [Podcastle](http://podcastle.org/) short-form genre fiction [podcasts](http://escapepod.org/podcasting/)! From now on, when you need to work with editor at escapepod dot org, I'll direct your message or question where it needs to go, and expedite the response. I'll organize information, such as volunteers for narration and audio editing, into centralized spreadsheets and databases. Never fear: Steve Eley will be no less connected to the audience than he was before. In fact, we expect this will free him to send you more personal responses, with me fielding the administrivia for him. Thank you very much to everyone who [helped convince Steve](http://community.livejournal.com/penguicon/67771.html) to choose me for this position. You made a big difference! If you don't already listen to Escape Pod, [subscribe today](http://escapepod.org/subscribe/)!
