[![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000bx5df)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000bx5df/) Finished, the glaze is glorious. I will present it in the gaming schedule at ['Clave](http://www.conclavesf.org/). I recall that I have not yet actually linked to from this blog [my page about Shogi](http://nemorathwald.com/games/shogi-without-the-japanese-language). Unfortunately it's missing several images! I've got to dig out a backup CD. --Fixed. This is the first set, individually hand-carved before I had the stamps. Due to being worked by hand and slightly over-dry while sculpting, they're not as smooth as the stamped tiles. The runoff glaze that spills over the edge fills in the wrinkles in the roughened surface, making it look slightly dirty even after it's wiped off. Also the ones I've been making with the stamps are far more evenly regular in shape. Next I'll experiment with porcelain. I need screen printing equipment, for the boards. Anybody got a light box they can loan temporarily?

How big does the light box need to be?

At least 13"x18".

Heh heh, unfortunately, I forgot to make the Lances. So they still await their turn in the kiln. Currently I have no working car. But I'll often be in Wixom, and I expect to be in Ann Arbor during the upcoming week. I'm just not sure when. If you're willing to go to Wixom or my place in Hazel Park, let me know.
