I'll be at Buckeye Game Fest the weekend after that. I'm hoping to get to play these games:

[Alien Frontiers](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/48726/alien-frontiers) [Blue Moon City](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21882/blue-moon-city) [Domaine](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5737/domaine) [Goa](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9216/goa)

[The Great Fire of London 1666](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41569/the-great-fire-of-london-1666) [Jaipur](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur) [Ra](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra) [Rattus](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42452/rattus)

[Space Alert](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert) [The Speicherstadt](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66505/the-speicherstadt) [Tikal II: The Lost Temple](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/67180/tikal-ii-the-lost-temple)

According to their online list of the games in their library, of these, they only have Goa and Ra. But other attendees may bring some of the other games on the list. I'm excited.

Alien Frontiers has a fascinating story behind it. The inventor and publisher started a game company to publish it, raising funds through Kickstarter.com for a serious artist and quality manufacturing. [Here is the Kickstarter page about it.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/clevermojogames/alien-frontiers-retro-future-sci-fi-board-game) It's a very promising new twist on using dice as workers in a worker-placement game.
