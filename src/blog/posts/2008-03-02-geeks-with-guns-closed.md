Garrett asked me to post this:

> Great news for Geeks with Guns! We've filled all of the available slots. Just another advantage of preregistration. The arrangements with the range have been finalized. We'll be shooting at [Firing Line Indoor Gun Range and Gun Shop](http://firinglineguns.com/). This is the same place we have enjoyed great service in years past. Everybody going will need to fill out the following[](http://firinglineguns.com/pdfs/RegistrationApplication.pdf)
