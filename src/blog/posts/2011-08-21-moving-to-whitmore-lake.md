I'm packing the last carload while moving out of Royal Oak. Looking around this room, I am filled with a rush of beautiful memories. I have had one of the most memorable years of my life here. The people local to here have provided a wonderful social life. My roommate is a good friend and we get along really well. And who can forget the hacker space? I like to keep a positive outlook, but it's a stressful time right now. There are a variety of things that could work out, and many of them probably will. But the positive features of having lived in Royal Oak are on my mind this weekend. Once I get settled down in Washtenaw County, and start reaping the benefits of being around all the people over there who I don't get to see enough, it will feel better. I already feel better by concentrating on that. Each new phase of my life has its own sources of joy. But the pressures are higher this time than normal, with fewer contingency plans. So at the moment I'm a little down.
