An excerpt from the beautiful a cappella "Gulf War Song" by Moxy Fruvous on their album _Bargainville_. ([MP3 link](http://nemorathwald.com/files/Gulf%20War%20Song%20excerpt%20-%20Moxy%20Fruvous_0.mp3))

> We got a call to write a song about the war in the Gulf But we shouldn't hurt anyone's feelings So we tried, then gave up, 'cause there was no such song But the trying was very revealing What makes a person so poisonous righteous That they'd think less of anyone who just disagreed? She's just a pacifist, he's just a patriot If I said you were crazy, would you have to fight me? Fighters for liberty, fighters for power Fighters for longer turns in the shower Don't tell me I can't fight, 'cause I'll punch out your lights And history seems to agree that I would fight you for me
