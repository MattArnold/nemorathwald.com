How long does the brewing process take? I should be back in town Saturday. :)

I'll be out of town at Marscon until Monday, but taking inventory I see that we're too low on a couple of ingredients anyway. Nutmeg oil, lime oil, food-grade gum arabic, 75% phosphoric acid, and carbonated water. I'll buy more of these and try to set up a cola making party next week with the consuite folks.

I made coffee this morning, which is infinitely better than cola, and I did it all by myself! :) -=ShoEboX=-

As an x-employee of Opencola, let me tell you that the recipe is gonna be disappointing :(

Which do you like better, Coke or Pepsi?

I'm a Coke guy myself.
