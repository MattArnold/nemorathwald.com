[Tor.com](http://tor.com/) is not your typical company website, once again proving why they're my favorite paper publisher. This site is a reader community, offering author/editor blogs, free original stories, and a cover art gallery. To generate anticipation before the site launched, they were giving away one free unrestricted ebook per week. Now that the site is launched, they're re-releasing [all of the ebooks in that program for free at the same time](http://tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=577), plus a new graphic novel. They kicked it off with [a new story set in the Old Man's War SF future](http://tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=story&id=49) by John Scalzi, and [a new story set in the Lovecraftian spy-agency setting](http://tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=story&id=61) by Charlie Stross. The grand opening is grand indeed-- worth checking out at the very least. I for one intend to stick around. When you register, please type Matt\_Arnold into the [User Search](http://tor.com/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=usersList) and add me, and if I know who you are I'll add you back.
