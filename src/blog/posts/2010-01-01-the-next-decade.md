I lived a new life during the past seven or so years. So, the story of the aughts is the only story to be told about the new me; there is no other; I already have said enough on this blog concerning making up for lost time. I will say only one thing: I wore these glasses for ten years. The padding has peeled off the bridge. I mistakenly used a paint-stripping abrasive soap on the lenses, which chafed part of their coating, looking like a ragged coastline. The earpieces are peeling their padding, blistering my ears. I love these glasses, because they don't have nose pads-- they rest on the bridge of the nose. I had no luck finding another pair like that. The post office has my new pair right now, to be donned in the new year. They are unlikely to be my only look for the next decade, since one of the changes in the past ten years was $10 online eyeglasses. The next decade excites me. With the education I'm pursuing, I feel like I've got my feet under me. I hope it will be the decade that I harness my passions to my earning power.

Re: your glasses: ![](http://sugru.com/images/uploads/repaired-glasses-sml.jpg) I have a packet pre-ordered and arriving in the mail. If you hadn't just gotten new glasses, you could pick up a regular pair, break off the nose bits, and use a bit o sugru on each side!

There's no reason I can't still do that!
