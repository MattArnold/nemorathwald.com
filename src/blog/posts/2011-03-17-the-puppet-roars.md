I'm at i3Detroit. My friend Rocco hacked the megaphone to add an audio input port. Bill and Tony ripped the audio from [Revenge of the Titans](http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/) to an mp3. The megaphone reproduces [the megatitan's roar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYndg0MraRo) at earth-shaking volumes! The parade puppet/costume itself is coming along well! All the [patterns](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/371703.html) are printed and cut. Next: assembly!
