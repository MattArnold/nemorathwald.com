Thank you to everyone who commented on my post on burnout. 1. Overcommitment I'm going to commit to less things. J helped tremendously by taking over PodDisc.com shipping from me. Now she's going to take over shipping "The Complete Lojban Language". I can feel sort of an emotional weight lifting off me by not having to keep track of any orders right now. And J needs the money anyway. I wish I could back out of U-Con entirely, but that would probably cause the most involved person to go catatonic with overwork, setting in motion a chain of dominoes that could topple the whole thing. The game design contest that I'm in is happening at U-Con, and that contest simply must go forward. I care a lot about that. The god damn Halloween party is in a week, and then it will be gloriously, luxuriously over. 2. Income and Debt Stress This is pretty much the majority of the problem, in my opinion. 3. Sleep Sleep is probably a factor. I think I should stop driving out to Lansing on Sunday nights to sit in Denny's playing Dominion until 7 in the morning. That requires a lot more caffiene than is good for me. 4. Therapy and Medication I haven't had medical insurance in four years, and I am living off educational debt. Maybe if I had a job I would pursue this. 5. Life Instability Many solutions were offered, which were quite good, but some of you felt like a certain amount of stability might be a solution. I don't feel attracted to the concept of stability, in general. There's really only one form of stability that I like the sound of right now, and that's a paycheck. When it comes to romantic and sexual relationship instability, I have an extensive philosophy which delivers results that I really like. Don't get me wrong. I am very interested in discussing different people's views on relationships, and I would definitely take that strongly under consideration. But duration is not the same thing as quality to me. Come to think of it, this philosophy might need an entire blog post. That's a good idea. I like to post about things that make me happy, confident and capable.

_I think I should stop driving out to Lansing on Sunday nights to sit in Denny's playing Dominion until 7 in the morning._ If you're going that far for a Dominion fix, I'm confident that I and others can assist, with much less driving required.

I'm not actually driving there specifically for gaming. Let's just say it has to do with not driving back when gaming is done. :)
