Today is Festifools! April Fools Day will be celebrated with giant puppets from 4 to 5 PM on Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor! Unfortunately I'll have to be a spectator. Somehow I hurt my back Friday night, and was in tremendous pain all day Saturday, which persists a little today although it's improving. I have been looking forward all year to participating in Festifools again. I considered pumping a lot of ibuprofen and muddling through, but realized I would only bring the event down if I try that. I will be there cheering them on, but I have to put off puppeteering until next year. I'm both disappointed, and sorry to let the event down.

I'm sorry to hear that you hurt your back. Did you do something to it while you were at our house? :( Also sorry to hear that you'll be missing out on Festifools.

No, it wasn't until about 10 PM, and I don't know how it happened. A complete mystery. I did get to participate in Festifools, though!

I saw that and was very happy. The puppet was great!
