Today is not the time for this to happen. J's moving out today and needs people to load the truck. Fortunately I can do some work from home. On my way out of work in Ypsilanti, I walk several blocks to my car. Yesterday I stepped off a curb onto a hilly street and came down on my foot sideways. A middle-aged lady stopped to help. When it became clear I couldn't hobble even when supported, went to her nearby house to give me free crutches. While she was gone, a college student who saw me from a distance arrived. I told her the other lady went to get crutches, and she said she would also give me crutches, and it would be a race. The first person came back with crutches, and I told her this. So I practiced with crutches and waited for the second person to return. The first lady told me to donate the crutches to charity when I was done with them, and left. The college student returned with crutches, and offered to drive me to my car. So we went to her house, where she invited me in, put a bag of frozen corn on my ankle, and talked about possibly hiring me to design her website. I know the economy is bad, but all in all, this is not the way I should be looking for work!

I know the economy is bad, but all in all, this is not the way I should be looking for work! Quite. But hey, if opportunity is going to knock...

You gotta take your networking opportunities when you can... Do you have any health insurance right now? Getting an aircast to immobilize your ankle would be a good thing if it's truly sprained. I have one from my sprain earlier this year, but I'm in Ann Arbor... Do you want to send by mail?

I have no health insurance. I'd like an aircast, yes! I'll email you.

My sister sent me this link to an article about a health center for people without insurance. It's on Woodward in Royal Oak. I'll be checking it out one of these days. http://www.dailytribune.com/articles/2010/10/27/news/doc4cc83eb9eb50f857380773.txt

Thanks very much. It's "faith-based", so I'm going to have to check to see if I have to sit through a sales pitch. But it looks promising.

We were reading your twitters with apprehension at first, and then a bit of laughter, "Only Matt would start out with a sprained ankle and then find himself with an opportunity out of it!" Which isn't quite true, but it is good that you were open to what the world was throwing your way, so to speak.
