OK, this happened yesterday and was unveiled at the concom meeting last night, so I don't have to keep it secret anymore. Chris DiBona told Penguicon's past GoH Nat Torkington that he intends to accept our invitation to be the main tech guest for [Penguicon 4.0](http://www.penguicon.org)! Mr. DiBona is in charge of Open Source Software for Google. Let me say that again portentiously and with hand-waving: **Goooooooooooogle**. The biggest and coolest hype factory out there. The company that Microsoft fears. The future Microsoft. All hail our distributed overlords! Chris has founded two tech companies, Konstrux Technologies and Damage Studios. He used to work with past Penguicon Guests of Honor Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda and Jeff "Hemos" Bates who run one of the web's biggest websites, [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org/), and was a Slashdot editor at one time, so he looks forward to seeing them. Chris co-edited an O'Reilly book, _Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Software Revolution_, and currently does segments about Linux for the Screensavers show on Tech TV. We've also got Frank Hayes, a long-time associate of the Dorsai irregulars, who in addition to being one of the most prominent filk musicians is a tech columnist for Computer World and Linux.org. Filk will be really big at Penguicon this year. I think tech guests have more flexible schedules than entertainers and that's why they're easier to get. We have to work twice as hard on our fandom GoHs. Undoubtedly the SF/F fans are wondering when Penguicon will offer them a guest of the superhuman caliber we have had in the first two years. Well we're working on an... entertainer (whether it is books/media/etc I will not specify)... whose attendance draw will make us examine the fire codes for maximum people in the hotel... That's all I'll say about that...
