There is still no computer on the desk at the place where I was supposed to start a temp assignment almost two weeks ago. They keep postponing it until they can get their IT department into gear. So for now, no work, and no $12.50. Maybe next week. In the meantime, if anybody wants to do lunch or hang out, I'm totally free.

Oh that's a drag. As an employee, at least you'd be sitting there at that empty desk, motivating someone to get the IT department kicked in the ass. As a temp, they don't have to pay you while you're waiting, so there's SO much less motivation. Pity I'm working so much, or lunch would be great.

What would happen if you brought in a laptop?

The only laptop I have is an antique with no ethernet, and they use special software that synchronizes the latest changes from their product and pricing database to the catalog in the page layout application.

Is this through the Creative Group? You are being held hostage here, possibly losing out on other opportunities. I think I'd bitch about the lost wages and possibilities.
