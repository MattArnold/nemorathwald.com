[![](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000a8z5a/s320x240)](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/pic/000a8z5a/g14) Last Thursday I finally cast my sculpture of Linux-Tan in Tomak's workshop. What a wonderland that place is! We made a hollow casting by strapping the mold to a Lawnmower-man style motorized [armillary sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere) while curing the plastic. It wasn't a sphere, though; the racks were square. I've learned a lot from this process which I'll apply to make future projects better. The mold had to be torn into about six parts to remove the casting. It might be salvagable, or it might not. In that case I'll make a new, superior mold from this casting, for the sake of education if nothing else. Ideally, I'll someday cast this in foam to serve as a puppet. That's why he's in a neutral pose. It remains only to grind down a couple of places with my Dremel tool, patch and smooth a few spots with Bondo, sandpaper it, and paint it in time for [CafePenguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/wiki/CafePenguicon) at [Youmacon](http://www.youmacon.com/).

By the way, I've started scanning Tomak's photos of the process of moldmaking and casting his glorious fountain, and posting them to my Flickr account. It depicts his legion of volunteers, among that number [I'm pleased](http://www.flickr.com/photos/34429085@N00/270422788/) to [be included](http://www.flickr.com/photos/34429085@N00/270427291/). Subscribe to [my Flickr photostream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/34429085@N00/) if you want to see the rest as I continue to scan and post them.

That looks really great! However, I can't believe that's really Tomak's workshop. It looks so clean!

That's the workbench in my basement. My camera wasn't working at Tomak's workshop.
