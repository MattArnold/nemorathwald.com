Here's another one of those memes spreading through the internet. It works this way. Anyone and everyone reading this post, even total strangers, are invited to post a response. Yes, that means you. List something which you would like to do with me someday. Then post to your own livejournal to ask what people want to someday do with you, and I'll post a response to that. I noticed that this assignment rules out things you want to do at the very next available opportunity. I assume it has to do with finding out what things the people around you are putting off for the future. If you really don't have any ideas, you could get out a copy of [Morton's List](http://www.mortonslist.com) and roll the thirty-sided die for an activity.

I'd like to make Reuben sandwiches and discuss the implications of free will on morality.

I would like to declare my dorm room my very own country and charge admission. Since this assignment says that you need to be involved, I, Queen Regina of Tacoland, Knight thee, Sir Matt\_Arnold.

Hrmmmm that's a toughy... I would like to get settled and have you come over once a week for cappucino and coffee and mind blazing discussions.

Hrm. Quiestly crash a Fundamentalist service, sit in the back, and compare both reminiscences and snide commentary...? Then go get food. (:
