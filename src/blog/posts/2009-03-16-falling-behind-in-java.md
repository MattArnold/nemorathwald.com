I got an A on my midterm, but fear that employment and Penguicon might start getting in the way of my education. This concerns me deeply. For instance, instead of working on the homework that is due Wednesday, I chose to spend both days of the weekend working on Penguicon almost non-stop at the homes of , and , and the storage cube. Work will let me leave at 3:00 PM on days I have class, if I arrive at work at 7:30 AM. So I got up at 5 AM. Due to traffic and fueling, it took an hour and a half to drive from work to my Java class that starts at 4:00, so I actually arrived at 4:30. Unfortunately I also had to miss all two hours of the last class in order to work my first day on the job. It's been half an hour here, and I realized that having missed the last two and a half hours of instruction has left me totally lost on what we are currently doing. So, I am spending the time mostly reading my textbook on the topic, interfaces and implementing in Swing, which is Java's graphical-user-interface extension. edit: It now appears the class finally covered Arrays while I was not looking.

Hang on tight if you're doing GUI stuff -- I'm taking my first GUI class (using Qt and C++ rather than Swing and Java) after a good three years of programming classes, and it's a tough subject. It might actually not be as bad if you have less experience programming without a GUI though; part of what makes it so hard is that everything you used to know about programming doesn't apply anymore, because everything is all model-view-controller and event driven and different.

Anything I can take-over Penguicon-wise that would lighten your load for a bit?

I need to see you send a PDF of the program front matter to the concom list. It doesn't have to be finished, just something for people to look at and think about.

How's the new calculator assignment coming? Anything I can help with tonight -- arrays or Swing?
