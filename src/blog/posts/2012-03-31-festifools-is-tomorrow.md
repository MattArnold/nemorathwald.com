![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_UPFOrt_gMo/TZo2WNnpfdI/AAAAAAAAIck/ElNo5Jevwpk/s720/megatitanpuppet2.jpg) Come out tomorrow for the annual April Fool's Day parade in Ann Arbor! Festifools is 4 PM on Main Street between William and Liberty. Giant puppets will run up and down the street in a jubilant festival. A couple of weeks ago, Karen asked me how we're going to top the puppet I made for last year's Festifools (seen above), because that was so much fun. We were short on time, so I came up with an idea that could be done quickly. It's a fifteen-foot-tall character made out of multi-colored nylon mesh, on a framework on coat hanger wire and bamboo. She did most of the sewing, and I made most of the structure. We just finished! Please be there tomorrow and see it!
