A promotional website for an upcoming iPhone app appears to be better than the app it's promoting. When you scroll down on [the Ben the Bodyguard website](http://benthebodyguard.com/) (warning, comics kind of NSFW), an animated story unfolds. Like a graphic novel, the changes to the webpage proceed at the pace set by your scroll wheel, and all without the use of Flash. The problem is that [the developers say](http://www.fastcompany.com/1708233/ben-the-bodyguard) they were mistaken to create such popularity and buzz for the app, when it honestly doesn't do very much to secure your iPhone. What do you do when the promotion is better than the product? It turns out they have a background in film, not software development. Ben the Bodyguard will achieve much more fame as a web comic character than as the web app named for him.
