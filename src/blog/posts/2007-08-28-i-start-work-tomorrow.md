[MP3 link: Olympic Fanfare and Theme, excerpt](http://nemorathwald.com/files/Olympic_Fanfare_and_Theme_excerpt.mp3) The long night is _over._ Ride now! Ride for ruin, and the world's ending! Pop the champagne! Kill the fatted calf! Seize the day! Wake the neighbors! Anchors away! Hoist the mainsail! Make fast _the stanchions_. Spare no blood, sweat or tears! Full speed ahead! On, on to glorious destiny!

This calls for Martenelli's at the next meeting! (Martenelli's is sparkeling apple cider we use as an alternative to champagne where I am from.)

Right down the street!

They manufacture and/or sell industrial tools. I would send you to [Valenite.com](http://www.valenite.com), but it's down right now. It will fall to me to mend that.

The Olympic Theme is Copeland's "Fanfare for the Common Man". Best of luck!

No. It sounds similar, so it's an understandable mistake. The recording I put up is composed by the movie score composer John Williams.
