I've been a bystander to some interesting conversations between Concom members about Nifty Guests at [Penguicon](http://penguicon.org/). I've been watching the process of Nifty selection up-close-and-personal under four consecutive Conchairs. It has never been organized and usually nobody has the slightest clue what Nifty even means. Every year we made our share of mistakes in who we gave the status to. But I've listened to a lot of philosophies expressed about it over the years, and condensed what I thought were the most helpful, meaningful set of non-contradictory definitions into an answer on our FAQ page.

> "Nifty Guest" is a status we confer on those who are _not_ our Guests of Honor this year, but have been in the past, or they are celebrities in their own right. We only have about twenty or fewer Nifty Guests per year, although that number gets slightly larger each year from the original two. It is not simply to be used an award for people we like who have done things we admire. It is for two kinds of people. - Celebrities or leaders within their specific subculture or internet community. They have a fanbase within that subculture to whom they announce, "you can meet me at Penguicon," so they are an attendance draw. - Those who are going to attend Penguicon to provide a specific event which is so glittery and shiny for our attendees that it stands above our other programming. When we feel we can't do without them, but they can't attend without a little modest financial help, sometimes we have Niftified them. This second type of Nifty has been kept deliberately rare, maybe one per year. "Program Participant" is a general term for anyone who delivers a presentation, is on a discussion panel, runs a scheduled game, or is featured in any other scheduled event at Penguicon. Those who are not designated a Guest of Honor or Nifty Guest receive a discounted admission rate for providing Penguicon content. The reality is, **all our Program Participants are truly nifty** in the sense of the English adjective. But each year I've seen us turn down several potential program participants because they couldn't show up without a free membership badge. As an all-volunteer not-for-profit convention (and one that is relatively new and still building financial security), we can't do that yet.

So you can see, as Conchair for next year I have some pretty well-defined ideas about it, and I'm going to be able to give some clear guidance to the people involved in Nifty selection. Others will disagree completely or have variations on it, and that's fine. **1\. We have to limit it somehow.** What is the basic problem we're trying to solve by defining Nifties? We have all the supply of them that we need at a convention for creative and intelligent people; the problem we're solving is narrowing them down somehow! Nifty was invented to solve the problem of having more celebrities attend our convention than we could actually pay Guest of Honor travel and hotel expenses for. To deal with a surplus of qualifications. See, the thing is, the basic challenge presented to us by defining a Nifty Guest qualification is not "what is Nifty?" but is "which set of restrictions will succeed in narrowing this immense field down to about 20 people?" Why is that? We have about a hundred Program Participants a year, and our Nifty designations are climbing to a silly percentage of that. Imagine that we completed saving our nest egg and we could let in all Program Participants for free like other conventions have done. (Whether to _ever_ do that has compelling advocates on both sides, but that's a long discussion for another time.) Calling all 100 of them Nifty Guests becomes just another way of saying Program Participant. It loses its distinction. A lot of people go to conventions to see their friends, so I'm hearing some local very popular friends say that maybe they ought to be Niftified as an attendance draw. As much as I like my friends and wish to tell the world how Nifty they truly are, I humbly suggest that this way lies madness. More and more people will expect us to follow through on that principle consistently. We'd go around labeling gold star stickers on the convention attendees who are well-liked and have a lot of friends who come to conventions to see them. The absence of a gold star would be the implied equivalent of a black dot sticker officially sanctioned by the convention, saying you are lackluster, not a witty conversationalist and a person of mediocre average fun. This would include many good and fine people. Nifty is not simply to be used as an award for people we like who have done things we admire, or it would fail to narrow down the field to something meaningful. Sadly, the name "Nifty" is confusing on that point. I'd go back in time to change it if I could, but I can't. **2\. We need clearer guidelines** From the outside, this looks like a corrupt buddy system. Heck, it looks that way from the inside when nobody has guidelines! But it isn't. The people involved are quite sincere.

**3\. We can be flexible with one or more guidelines at a time.** This point of the FAQ is ripe for abuse:

> Those who are going to attend Penguicon to provide a specific event which is so glittery and shiny for our attendees that it stands above our other programming. When we feel we can't do without them, but they can't attend without a little modest financial help, sometimes we have Niftified them. This second type of Nifty has been kept deliberately rare, maybe one per year.

I wish I had not put that on the internet, and just kept it quiet, because we keep having to fend off the floodgates that it has opened. But somebody would point out when we had done it and ask "what's up with that?" Interpret it conservatively, please. Seriously, to qualify for this exemption a Nifty must have [built a fusion reactor in their basement at the age of seventeen](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/nov/19/teen_creates_nuclear_fusion_basement/) or something equivalent. I'd like to replace that part of the FAQ with saying we can flex a little, and then we may as well put our guidelines out there once we're comfortable with them. We can consider Nifty Guest a _radial category_. A radial category has a prototype which has all the traits, and other things that are still in the category even though they are missing some of the traits. (I got this idea from Eric Raymond in [a presentation he gave](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sf-history.html) at the first Penguicon.) To quote, a radial category

> is not defined by any one logical predicate, but by a central prototype and a set of permissible or customary variations. As a simple example, in English the category "fruit" does not correspond to any uniformity of structure that a botanist could recognize. Rather, the category has a prototype "apple", and things are recognized as fruits to the extent that they are either (a) like an apple, or (b) like something that has already been sorted into the "like an apple" category. Radial categories have central members ("apple", "pear", "orange") whose membership is certain, and peripheral members ("coconut", "avocado") whose membership is tenuous. Membership is graded by the distance from the central prototype â€” roughly, the number of traits that have to mutate to get one from being like the prototype to like the instance in question. Some traits are important and tend to be conserved across the entire radial category (strong flavor including sweetness) while some are only weakly bound (bright color). In most radial categories, it is possible to point out members that are counterexamples to any single intensional ("logical") definition, but traits that are common to most of the core prototypes nevertheless tend to be strongly bound. Thus, "coconut" is a counterexample to the strongly-bound trait that fruits have soft skins, but it is sorted as "fruit" because (like the prototype members) it has an easily-chewable interior with a sweet flavor.

There are strongly-bound traits and weakly-bound traits of being a Nifty Guest. To be in the category, a Nifty Guest can lack maybe one strongly-bound trait, or lack two weakly-bound traits. But at least we'll have a list of traits to compare to, as opposed to our current flailing our limbs about us. The cool thing about this is that it won't fracture when it runs up against real life.

**4\. The real purpose of the guidelines is to get an arbitrary number, but as long as they're there, each guideline may as well help us.** To be the least arbitrary, it's good for our limiting factors to help make the convention better in a way that it wouldn't have been already. It's unromantic for me to say this, but if we're going to market them on our promotional materials, that has the word "market", which means we expect the Nifty's name should deliver the goods on a _financial_ level. Show us their fan club mailing list with lots and lots and lots of rabid fans on it. Or a forum about them. Or their blog on which their readers comment so frequently that they make friends there. If we'll get at least two people in their fanbase who will attend because they heard on their email list/forum/blog that you'll be there, that means we made a lot more money on registrations than we spend on feeding the Nifty in the Consuite. That's a strongly-bound trait of Nifty Guests. That is a clear benefit to the convention that we weren't getting already, and helps limit to about 20 Nifites. I suggest that a weakly-bound trait should be "they live far enough away that we don't see them at every con, or they were not already going to show up anyway". That is a clear benefit to the convention that we weren't getting already, and helps limit to about 20 Nifties. Another weakly-bound trait could be that a prototypical Nifty is-- if not a pro-- then at least spending an amazingly large amount of time pursuing their area of expertise, comparable to a part-time job. We're a convention specifically for amateur contributions, so why have this guideline? Ironically, we need this guideline precisely because we're a convention about amateur contributions-- otherwise most of our attendees would qualify! Let's not say "pro", let's say "spends an amount of time on their avocation comparable to a part-time job." Let's say for example, Jorge Castro before he was hired by Canonical to do what he was doing already. Or Tom Smith before he quit his day job.

![](http://www.cindyvallar.com/barbossa1.jpg)

The code is more like guidelines, really.

So what have we got? Two or more of the following: 1. Strongly bound trait: Fan base who will attend for no other reason than they heard Nifty will be there 2. Strongly bound trait: Good to put on programming 3. Weakly bound trait: If not professional, at least spends an amount of time on their avocation comparable to a part-time job 4. Weakly bound trait: Lives far away and/or would not otherwise attend the convention 5. Weakly bound trait: Invited as a full Guest of Honor at other conventions Remember, **radial category**! Most Nifties lack one or more of these, and that's fine. So a prospective Nifty really needs to meet at least one strongly-bound trait, and has to make up for it with weakly-bound traits. If they meet all of them they are the prototype Nifty of which other Nifties are variations. This system should be tweaked some more. More ideas are welcome, but remember, does your idea solve the problem of limiting the number to 20? And does it do this in a way that squeezes maximum benefit to Penguicon out of the Nifty Guest? Keep in mind before you comment, the suggested guidelines are about the prototype Nifty, not all Nifties!

To be honest, I thought "Nifty Guest" just meant "we list you on the website and you can use the Green Room". I didn't realize they were paid GoHs.

Nifties have, in the past, been listed in the non-Website advertising for the con (i.e. the flyers). I know this because I nearly fainted when I saw my name on a Penguicon flyer! Somehow, I don't imagine anyone but my closest friends would decide to come or not come to a con based on whether I was planning to be there.

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Feb. 21, 2008 2:34 AM

I'm still trying to figure out how I ever qualified as a Nifty. (I forget which year that was; it was only done the one year, that I recall.) I'm not a celebrity, in either the fannish or mundane senses--at best, I'm merely married to one. I was a GOH at Arisia, once, but that was alongside Eric, and that probably was due to the "married to celebrity" phenomenon (see above). Possibly my Nifty status was justified by the "good to put on programming"; I've certainly done my fair share of that, at Penguicon, Linucon and elsewhere.

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Feb. 21, 2008 2:36 AM

On the subject of the guidelines--why do you need an arbitrary number of Nifties? Nifties only get paid registration, not expenses. So use that figure to decide how much money to spend on Nifties. Then brainstorm for as many Nifties you can think of, invite all of them until the money runs out. Then put the rest on the Nifty list for the next year. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I was given a soft maximum of "less than thirty" which I had originally tried to divide up among the tracks. I was never given a budget, per se. If I have this job again next year, I plan on trying to greater push the "divided evenly among the tracks" idea. (Remember, the idea that was a "good solution to a problem we don't have"?) This year, the system worked as a "someone suggests a Nifty. If it doesn't get turned down, we invited them." We still haven't hit the soft limit of thirty.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 2:51 AM

Yes, I'd say the system has worked out this year at least as well, or at least not worse, than previous years. And that's pretty satisfactory. Next year we'll do such a good job that we'll take a good situation and bring it to level 11.

**[ext_61514](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_61514)** on Feb. 21, 2008 2:53 AM

I've noticed Dept. Heads are much happier when they have Nifties they -want-. I have some ideas on how to do some Nifty suggestion stuff for next year.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 3:07 AM

Ooh, that is a super trait. "There is someone who wants to come up with ideas of schedule events to put them on." That is so incredibly important. I can't decide if it's strongly or weakly bound, but my gut says to go with strongly.

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 4:32 AM

Molly, I just checked out the database which has a field for the status of each person, and found out about a lot of Nifties I didn't know about. Can you check that list, confirm the ones that aren't on the website, and get me web blurbs and pictures?

---

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Feb. 21, 2008 3:31 AM

That's not bad so long as there's plenty of money in the kitty and/or people are too unimaginative to think of more Nifties to invite. I'd rather see us generate a huge backlog of Nifties, choose the first x of them based on how many free memberships we're prepared to give in a particular year, and roll over the rest to start the next year's list. But what do I know? I've never tried to actually \*run\* a con. :-)

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 2:49 AM

The ever-increasing number of Nifties each year was chosen by the Conchairs. If I recall correctly, it was a financial decision most of the time, so the number wasn't completely arbitrary, although it was a judgement call. I intend to revisit that question for Penguicon 2009 when it comes time.

---

**[ext_110496](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_110496)** on Feb. 21, 2008 3:54 AM

The choice of Nifties will, and probably should, be a judgment call. But I'd like to see the con opt in favor of inviting as many Nifties as it can, rather than attempting to limit the number artificially.

The nifty guest concept was used initially to help promote Penguicon -- "Not only do we have these fine superlative GoH's coming, but you may run into these other celebrities who will be attending." This also helped differentiate Penguicon from other local cons who didn't do this sort of promotion of other cool people who attend. It's interesting to see that at least Fusion has started mentioning other celebs that are showing up. And Celebrity is probably the best term to use -- as a celebrity is someone who's famous for being famous -- people, at least with a certain genre have heard of this person. Another guidline to consider in inviting nifties -- Is there a general theme being presented for a particular con? Will that person enhance the theme? But basically, nifties are guests that we are encouraging to attend. We don't officially do more than comp their entrance, but sometimes other means are used like helping them with travel/lodging, but that is done outside of the budget, or through an advertising trade, or other creative endeavor. What it comes down to, is that nifties are invited at the pleasure of the conchair. If it makes sense to the conchair, and it won't kill the budget, then do it. If you try to engineer a solid set-in-stone process to formalize this then you will kill a large measure of the spontenaity and freedom to create a con as a work of art. Think of the con as creating a feast -- there should be hors d'ourves, there should be some sort of starter, there should be a main course, there should be a desert. Which wine will you serve with each course? Will there be port or cognac or scotch afterwards? Do you offer coffee, as well? What music do you have? Any other entertainment? You, along with the concom, get to create this wonderful, sensual feast. There are guidelines, certainly, there are expectations, but you have a lot of degrees of freedom in exactly what peices are chosen to fill any particular slot. I gave you a lot of input in crafting 5.0 -- as I had a couple guests I wanted, but other than that was pretty sanguine as to the rest of the mix. You wanted to focus on guests that had helped create the Singularity concept, and we did a pretty good job in attracting them. And lo, and behold, we created a good con. And that, in the long run, is the important goal -- on Sunday hearing people talk about what an amazing and fun time they had.

I see what you mean about supplementing the GoHs with other people who work well with them. That is a good weakly-held trait. Some Conchairs won't pay any attention to Nifty selection whatsoever. I'm pleased to hear that you had a thoughtful philosophy about this topic. This system expresses my philosophy on it as chair. I'm just going to communicate it this time. We need a healthy spread of Nifties throughout the tracks, or the fiction authors will dominate the Nifty slate if left unchecked. It's a widely-held view, and I can't say I can argue much with the idea. This means the track heads will have to select the ones that the conchair didn't select directly, the way I selected the Singularity-related celebs last year (this year too, with Vinge, Yudkowski and Best). Therefore, the track heads need to not be in the dark about what they're looking for, among people they like who have done things they admire. Explicit guidance will encourage them to actually think about it, because a lot of tracks have never had Nifties or a track head who sought them!

'Fusion has mentioned other celebs on their flyers, sometimes, for as long as I can remember. But doing this requires a level of organization we don't always have. I think Penguicon's "Nifties" thing has acted as a reminder to get organized early enough to make those kind of mentions. You've also got a different situation with 'Fusion, as far as the comped registrations go. Fifteen years ago, 'Fusion used to comp every single one of its program participants. But at that time, the programming was pretty anemic, and with a strong history we had enough money in the bank to do it. We started steadily increasing the quantity and quality of programming at 'Fusion, and this made the universal comping policy a bit problematic. Especially since the organization had slid into a mode where department heads would find programming berths for their friends just to get them those comps. When I took over as chair I found a situation where something like 1/3 of the people attending were being comped for one reason or another, the con was buying rooms for way too many people, and we were not breaking even. I had to try to rein this in. I think every con chair has to pay at least a little attention to this type of thing, or the finances go downhill really fast. Comps and free rooms one year become entitlements the next year, no one likes to say no, and there are always far more deserving people than there is money. So I think Matt is doing the right thing, with his attempt to clearly articulate the goals and the limits of the Nifties program.

What are the benefits of being a nifty guest?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 8:37 PM

Free admission, access to the green room, a picture and short bio on the web and in the program book, and an egoboost which I think is diluted if there are too many of them. Due to a unique and happy set of circumstances regarding hotel rooms for 2009, I'm considering expanding the benefits during my year. But I don't want to go into detail about that now in case it doesn't work out.

---

**[ext_46539](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_46539)** on Feb. 21, 2008 8:52 PM

"a picture and short bio on the web" Have you thought about doing this for more of your panelists, say those just below nifty status like a local author or big name fan in general?

---

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Feb. 21, 2008 8:56 PM

It sounds like a fine idea, but then wouldn't we need to do it with all or at least most of them? Hunting those down is quite a workload, when we currently don't even have two-thirds of our Nifties on that page.

---

**[ext_46539](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_46539)** on Feb. 21, 2008 10:25 PM

In that case I can see why you don't.
