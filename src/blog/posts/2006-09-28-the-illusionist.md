and I saw "[The Illusionist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443543/)" on Sunday. I enjoyed that movie. It was about the question of whether a 19th-century stage magician could truly perform supernatural magic. His childhood sweetheart was a Baroness and the fiance of the Crown Prince for political reasons. They knew he would hunt them down and kill them if they tried to run away together; they could never be safe. When they tried to escape anyway, the Crown Prince murdered her. That began a murder mystery about the supernatural. Or... is it all a con-man trick story? Director and co-screenwriter Neil Burger worked very hard to keep both theories plausible, and the audience couldn't be sure until the very end. The tension was kept alive by the fact that I knew he could satisfyingly resolve the plot either way. From one point of view, a love that can be conjured from beyond the grave is a more emotionally powerful story. But the trick version of events is a smarter story. I believe those two facts, and the characters' awareness of them, were what the movie was ultimately _about_. These are two different things that audiences go to movies to see, and this technique permitted us to enjoy both of them.
