Oops, I forgot to post directions to my house today! It's 23090 Majestic Street, Oak Park, MI 48237. [Google maps link.](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=23090+Majestic+St,+Oak+Park,+MI+48237) The party's started, but we've still got some chairs unoccupied and you can join us!

I'm sorry I missed it. I had hopes of getting over for it, which evaporated when my son's social group finale lasted until 8:30 pm. Kind of late to head for Oak Park on a School Night.... We're all looking forward to the Two Billionth Second, or will that be your retirement party? :-)
