An audio file of [Friday's Russ and Dee radio show](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/50416.html) is now online at: http://www.subliminallusion.com/universism/031805russanddee.mp3 Having listened to the show again, personally, I think I hit it out of the ballpark. My call-in begins about a third of the way through the file and ends about half-way through. I'd like to extract that section into a separate audio file for the convenience of my friends, but I don't know how and I don't have the web space.

I have a program that can do that, although I've never used that feature before and am not really sure how to do it, but I can play around with it if you like.

Great! Thanks! Now to find web space. I think the Universists might host it.
