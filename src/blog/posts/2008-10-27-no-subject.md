Oops. There has been a calendar mistake.  I need somewhere else to be for Wednesday through Saturday night of this week. Is anyone willing to take a houseguest? It would not need to be for the whole time, because I can find multiple couches to crash on.

My sofa is always open.

You can crash here also. I will actually not be here during that time except for Thursday night (and is there any possibility you could drive me to the airport Friday morning?). We just got the guest bed up into the back bedroom so you could use that room.
