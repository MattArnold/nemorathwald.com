I had a follow-up job interview today. If hired, I'll move to Whitmore Lake. If not hired, I'll move to Clarkston.

Why clarkston?

I've had multiple offers; these are two of them. Each comes with benefits and costs. The benefits in Whitmore Lake are higher (particularly, being close to the job), but the costs in Clarkston are lower.

I grew up in Clarkston. It's a nice place. :-) hope you get the job though, assuming it's what you want...

It's weird; I really liked living in Ypsilanti, and you hate it. You think Clarkston is a nice place, I think it's a godforsaken wilderness.

I actually don't hate Ypsi; there was just a time that I didn't want to live there if it was at all possible to live in A2 and be closer to work and downtown and everything. I have an Ypsi mailing address now but it's really Pittsfield Twp, I'd rather be in A2 again if I could afford it but only really for commuting purposes. I haaaaaate commuting any longer than I have to. There are some places in Ypsi I don't feel comfortable in, but I don't hate the place as a whole; I'm more indifferent than anything wheras I actually like A2 for the neat things it contains. Now Clarkston from the POV of a person heavily active in fannish communities is definitely a godforsaken wilderness. You can find most everything you need there except a large healthy community of fannish types. There are a few though!

Fortunately I seem to have found a few! They're the ones I would move in with, if I move there.
