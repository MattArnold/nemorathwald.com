One of my roommates did something to my alarm clock so it would allow them to sleep in this weekend. So, I overslept this morning. Pulling out of the driveway in my haste, I knocked a power outlet box off of the house. My driver's-side mirror bent all the way back; fortunately it sprung back into position when released and seems none the worse for wear. There are only scrapes on the car. But I will be replacing that outlet box.

Your roommates need a LARTing. \*evil grin\*

Nah. It's my fault. I should have had the presence of mind to set up the alarm clock to not go off while I was planning to not sleep there. That way I would know what had been done to it, so I could put it back the way it was. As it stands now, I'm not sure what switch or dial is out of place to prevent it from going off.

/rant = on The **LOUD** and **OBNOXIOUS** alarm clock is not missed since you moved out. Do you know that thing runs for **TWO HOURS** before it shuts itself off? Do you know how many times I had to get up and shut the damned thing off instead of getting a nice snooze in? /rant = off

No, I didn't. I'm not attached to it. Can you recommend a better model?

Virtually anything that requires you to TURN OFF the alarm, and then reset it for the next day. ;-) Your palm pilot can make a dandy alarm clock, too.
