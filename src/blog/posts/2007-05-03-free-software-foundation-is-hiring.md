This is on [the website of the Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/news/hiring-campaigns-manager):

> The Campaigns Manager implements the FSF communications strategy and works as part of a team to develop and implement issue campaigns and community resources, acting as a spokesperson on matters of software freedom. The Campaigns Manager handles writing, editing, speaking, and research related to these activist and program efforts; coordinates the GNU Chief Webmaster and the other webmaster volunteers to develop FSF and GNU web sites; plans and implements proposals to increase fundraising; and serves as a main point of contact between the Foundation and the free software community.

It goes on to say:

> \* You must be a free software activist with a commitment to computer user freedom. \* Excellent written communication skills, able to demonstrate that you can work in a precise way whilst handling multiple tasks. \* A good public speaker with experience of handling press relations. \* Experience of organizing events and handling community relations in a diplomatic way. \* Possess the technical skills of a Webmaster. \* Candidates must support the principles of Software Freedom and demonstrate their knowledge of the policies and work of the Foundation.

Know of anybody like that? Maybe we can find one in [the back of the Penguicon 2007 program book. (PDF link)](http://www.rlnj.org/chuck/Information Ecology.pdf)

Hrm. . . Think references from Cory Doctorow and Eric Raymond are worth anything for this sort of job?

Actually sounds kind of fun. You better hurry before I beat you to it.
