Now that Superstruct is over, here are my badges:

My final survival score: 42 out of 100 [Descriptions of all 10 Superstruct powers](http://superstructgame.com/s/survivability_FAQ) I suspect there were about 100 real players. Total badges (other than High Ping Quotient) won by everyone as of November 13: ![](http://api.ning.com/files/zUH2ty*xasjegigdkD-HitN3Irpk22YHFtq14e8DVpyGt4qfhF7C5tbevT83Gcpj4QP97CM74WQMRPUxlXWjSheoU8WW1Kpj/wonbadgesnotpingq.gif?width=600) I recreated the badges in hi-res from the originals by John Hersey and put them in [this album](http://struct.ning.com/photo/albums/hires-badge-remakes). I also invented my own new "anti-badge": ![](http://api.ning.com/files/zUH2ty*xasi9DuTiBpz6IQV79mdA0ieQXyo2sX68SxOF1G89o9QY7I4ahlHgsgkj04P8TlwqaFOShNeSdmJqG4xLKZE0OnEw/handbaskency.gif?width=600)
