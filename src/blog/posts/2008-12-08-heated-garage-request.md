Hey, I neglected to mention on Friday that thanks to and his hacksaw, my car is now working. The bad nut and bolt are replaced. I also purchased a whole replacement connector for the negative battery terminal. I would like to install that, but to do so, I would definitely need to borrow space in someone's heated garage. What am I saying? No one keeps cars in their garages. In the meantime, a copper wire is stuck in the existing connector to make a firm connection.

It's not even remotely close to anything convenient for you, but we have plenty of garage space. Much of it (all of it?) is not "heated" so much as "protected from wind and water and has space for electric heaters to be set up and turned on". Also, we have electric heaters. I'm in California until Wednesday, so if you plan to use the space before then, you might want to call John and let him know, if for no other reason than so he can bring an electric heater out for you to use.
