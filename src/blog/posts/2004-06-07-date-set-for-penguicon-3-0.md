Bill, Rachel and I met with Kimba and Ron at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org)'s storage cube. The indoor climate-control facility would make a neat Laser Tag arena. Anyway, the five of us went for ice cream and had a meeting at Baskin-Robbins. The date of April 22-24, 2005 has been settled on for [Penguicon 3.0](http://www.penguicon.org), and I'm in the process of updating the website.

Yay for setting the date! PenguiCon 3.0 will (hopefully) be my first con as a Michigan resident! :) -Karen \*The Emperor Penguin's random editing penguin :)\*

I'm glad The Emperor Penguin has a random editing penguin, since The Emperor Penguin seems to suffer from mild dyslexia sometimes. (He's also an atheist. Do you know what a dyslexic atheist is? Someone who doesn't believe there's a dog.) Since I'm Minister of Propaganda for Penguicon, would that mean you're on my staff? We were sitting in Baskin Robbins and Bill was saying something about how if he gets sick or abducted by aliens, there's a specific person who he has lined up to take over to run the convention. A long silence ensued, presumably as they stared at that person, but I wasn't looking. While he said this I was scrutinizing the ice-cream menu board with a strange degree of attention. I broke the silence by muttering something like "mmm, coffee banana frappe coolatta" or somesuch.

:) Yeah, I guess I am on your staff. Rock on! :) Oh, and don't worry, if Bill gets abducted by aliens, I'll be kickin' some major alien ass within minutes! btw... where is PenguiCon v3.0 gonna be? -Karen

It looks right now like it's almost certainly going to be the Novi Sheraton. We'll publicize that when we've got the contract signed.
