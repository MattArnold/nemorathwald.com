Forgive me for being less responsive than usual lately. I've been in Cleveland for the past several days without internet access, except when in a public library. [The jury-rigged super antenna](http://www.instructables.com/id/%22Poorman_s-WiFi%22--USB-adapters-%26-DIY-cookware-refl/step2/Parabolic-Asian-cookware/) has not availed me. I'm back home overnight, going back tomorrow AM, planning to return Saturday. It has been a delightful trip, with a wonderful road companion, and just as wonderful a host. I saw a lot of Cleveland, and played a lot of [Dominion](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) in Cleveland. Did you know it's a cool city? I didn't expect that. Maybe it's just the part I saw. It's a mix of Ann Arbor and Detroit-- the very well-kept, side-by-side with shuttered ruins. A huge public market appeared deceptively prosperous, for the secondmost recession-hit city in the nation. A few of the shoppes even sold foods labeled with the sort of [adjectives](http://www.picturesforsadchildren.com/index.php?comicID=325) marketed to the [wealthy](http://www.picturesforsadchildren.com/index.php?comicID=154). Bands played in the park. Everyone was friendly. Everywhere I saw Clevelanders walk unafraid, usually with strollers and dogs. Walking tours, accommodations for cyclists, abundant public transit, and recycling. So basically civic life is thriving there. Perhaps the poverty was in other districts.

Neat -- I've seen that one on various PBS and foodie programs before. :)

It's the Tremont/Southside district. I took this photo of a mural there today: http://twitpic.com/2in044
