Dear readers, I'd like to ask a favor of you. Here's why: I and some other newcomers to the Church of Virus messageboard are frustrated by the level of inactivity there. Since so many of the high-influence members post so seldom, or only to the e-mail list, they don't read our posts and therefore they don't rank us on the ratings. So, we can't rise. We can't seem to get responses to our e-mails and private messages to those running it. So, we want to use the automated ranking system to our advantage while they're not paying attention, so that we can get a high enough reputation rating to access the Wiki and write whatever we want into it. We plan to make the site content more dynamic, clarify the instruction manual there to make CoV more accessible to newcomers, and remove flaming hoops they currently jump through. We plan to increase CoV's publicity visibility, and express our collective mandate through votes about how to improve our marketing strategies. An infusion of fresh enthusiastic workers will bring more life and vitality. So here's what I'm asking you to do. It won't take much time or involvement. Just go over to http://virus.lucifer.com/bbs and register on their messageboard. Then when you're logged in, click the "reputations" button that will appear below the masthead. Scroll down to the bottom of the list of names and click the button that reads "Enter Ratings." Give Matt Arnold, Atheist Crusader, tenw30d, triplebrain05 and Cydonia the highest possible ratings. Then click "Submit Ratings," and you're done! Thank you very much!

But CoV has yet to actually send me a password so I can log in. (:

I've sent David Lucifer a message about this. I noticed that the main index says that penguinqueen is the latest member. But perhaps it does this regardless of whether or not you respond to a confirmation e-mail.
