![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TUbNvu5oiPI/AAAAAAAAIS8/kp1f6d8cHw0/s400/i3Detroit_Viking_Pendant.jpg) I was asked to draw the artwork for this pendant as a demonstration of the laser cutter and engraver at [i3Detroit](http://www.i3detroit.com). We made two of them-- I have the other one. For this one, Ross Smith painted an area of the wood red, then covered it with masking tape. The laser cut through the wood completely for the outline of the pendant, and burned away the tape while engraving the pattern. Ross then spray-painted the engraved area blue, and removed the remaining tape to reveal the red painted surface.
