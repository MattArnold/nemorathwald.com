I invented a clever technique to paint nests very fast. I should write a tutorial. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5CXGyYR-mDQ/TgpvGF3psuI/AAAAAAAAIlg/McSimUHoRHs/s400/nest.gif) At Origins this weekend, I repeatedly playtested a strategic dice game I invented, about falconry. I kept getting comments about the uniqueness of the theme, so a big thank-you goes out to Jody Raiford for that idea. I have been playtesting it with the local gaming groups for a few months, with a good reception, but it's always advisable to find strangers to give you the straight dope. The Origins gamers liked it enough that I decided to spend the extra time on illustrations.
