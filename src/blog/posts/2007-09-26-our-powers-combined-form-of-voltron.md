visited for dinner because we've been needing to talk about Penguicon 7.0 for 2009. Now that she's done with nursing school, she can once again apply her social clout and experience to the forward momentum of the convention committee and board. We discussed community-building and knowledge capture. We analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of our different organizational styles, and the styles of various super-useful people around us, and how all of them mesh together or fail to. I got out the whiteboard and notepads and drew diagrams of permission authorities and work responsibilities for some innovative roles, with which to potentially tweak some sides of the organizational structure. More about that on another day, maybe. A great load has lifted off my shoulders with overwhelming relief and excitement.
