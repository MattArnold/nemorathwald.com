I'd like to make some different-colored jigsaw-puzzle game tiles with a visible color on the edge when another tile is stacked on top of it. They could be wood, pressboard, plastic, or any stiff material; but unfortunately these usually only come in one color. Painting them before milling would only color the surface. Painting them after milling would cause drips that would be distinguishable by touch, when you pull the tile from a bag. I have not found any type of laser-cuttable stiff sheet, at least 1/4" thick, that is pigmented all the way through the material, not just on the surface. Google and Google Product Search did not avail me. My first thought was Sculpey. But safety reports say "when polymer clay is overheated enough or accidentally burned, the PVC will break down and release highly toxic hydrochloric acid gas." So much for laser-cutting Sculpey. I also thought of asking to use the MakerBot, but the plastic it extrudes only comes in black. Then I thought, if it comes down to it, perhaps print the 3D models with the MakerBot, cast them, and mold Sculpey with the casts.

I do not have a solution to your materials issue, but my brother gave me a link to this site and I think it could be handy to you: http://www.inventables.com/ Good luck (and I will give it more thought)

What an awesome site!

I believe there are some matt boards (for framing) that come with color cores. The color range is limited, though and it's not the cheapest material around. How about stain, dye or spray paint for permeable substrates?

Are you sure you couldn't paint the edges without drips? For example, my plaque belt pieces are thick wood, painted to look like gold, and don't have drips on the sides. Painting with sponge rather than brush is excellent for avoiding drips. Or am I missing some key detail about the pieces that would always cause drips?

There would be dozens of tiles, so I expect time-efficient methods might cause drips. I suppose it could work, even with spray paint, as long as I take the time to work carefully. Another problem with paint is that it's difficult to make a 3D model account for the thickness the paint would add. The jigsaw edges need to interlock. If I make it loose to guarantee that they'll fit, I might make it too loose and it would wobble around.

Thank you. That makes more sense now. Do the colors need to be bright? If not, tinted wood stains would color by soaking into the material, rather than forming a layer on top of the material, causing problems with the fit of the interlocking pieces.

Good idea. They don't need to be bright. That could do the trick. I wonder if I could get a stain to soak through a half-inch-thick sheet of wood. A quarter-inch is really just a minimum.

Colored plexiglass sheeting in a variety of thicknesses: https://www.estreetplastics.com/Colored\_Plexiglass\_Sheets\_s/109.htm It comes in a variety of thicknesses, is colored through and through, and can be laser cut: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly%28methyl\_methacrylate%29 Unfortunately, it is not cheap. Especially in 1/4 inch thicknesses. An alternative could be stained, rather than painted wood.

Stained wood, or you could use two different colors of wood - one dark and one light. Sanding the wood to create fine edges might be a lot of work though.

Awesome! Thank you!

Thinking off the top of my head... Hardwood that is stained would not have drips, but if the edges are all black from the laser it would mean having to sand every piece by hand. Colored acrylic sound promising, but only if you can locate multiple colors as small as large cutting boards. Not sure what local industries would have scraps of colored acrylic sheets. I might inspect floor tiles to see if any have the qualities you are looking for and would work in the laser. I'm guessing that marble might be too hard and linoleum too thin. Nothing definite there. If casting molds, would resin be easier to work with than Sculpy?

Having used both resin and polymer clay, I'm not sure resin would be easier. Less expensive, perhaps.

You might wan to think along the lines of inexpensive floor tiles, different colors, then jig-sawing them.
