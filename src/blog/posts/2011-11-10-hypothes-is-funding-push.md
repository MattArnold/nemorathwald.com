[Hypothes.is](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dwhly/hypothesis-taking-peer-review-to-the-internet) has raised $70,000, and will only be funded if they raise the remaining $30,000 in the next 3 days. I gave what I could. Is this something you'd consider donating ten bucks to? Or more? If the goal is not met, your funds will not be charged.
