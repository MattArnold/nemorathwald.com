I'm now the literature columnist for [The Sci Phi Show](http://thesciphishow.com/) podcast. [Today's minicast is the first installment of my segment, "Suspension of Belief."](http://thesciphishow.com/?p=125) More specifically than science fiction and philosophy, this recurring segment will try to consider science-fictional philosophies. Since I love science fiction and I love philosophy, I was of two minds when I started listening to The Sci Phi Show. On the one hand, I was thrilled by the idea of a podcast about science fiction and philosophy. On the other hand ... suffice it to say that readers of this blog might vividly remember the review I ran. The downside to excited anticipation about a great dream is that it magnifies the ability to feel disappointed. I proposed tapping my rolodex as Penguicon's [Head of Programming](http://www.penguicon.org/wiki/MattArnold) to start my own podcast on this topic. I got quite a few people excited about being interviewed. But let's face it, when I'm helping to run [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/), serving on the Board of Directors of the [Logical Language Group](http://www.lojban.org/), and all my other activities, there was no way to find the time! Recently I rethought what I had done. What was I building by posting that review? Nothing. What was I owed by the show? Nothing. There is no sense in going into detail at this time about what I said in my review. Those views have not changed, but my view of constructive relationships and diplomacy has changed. I decided it's in the best interest of everyone involved for me to turn a blind eye. When I believe in something passionately and care about its success, I can be uncompromising-- that can end up hurting it more than it helps. I took down the review and sent an apology to Jason Rennie, the host of the Sci Phi Show. Little did I know that he would be quite gracious and allow me to contribute a new segment for his audience and start sending interview candidates his way. I've already sent him the second segment, which will air in the next couple of weeks.

Jack Vance's "The Languages of Pao" springs immediately to mind. m.

A very entertaining take on the subject... I look forward to the next one, and I'm glad you could find a way to do this despite your definite time crunch. :)
