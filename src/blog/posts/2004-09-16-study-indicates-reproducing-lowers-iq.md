This article brought to mind the old saying, "Just wait until you have children of your own, then you'll see I'm right!" I recently read of another study that found becoming an authority figure rewires structures in the brain, but I can't find that article at this time. Indiana University study: having children significantly lowers parents’ IQs "A five-year study run by Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction proves what many in the scientific community have always suspected: having children significantly lowers the IQ of both male and female parents. Researchers at the Kinsey Institute began their study in 1999 by giving 200 married couples who were planning on starting families within the next four years Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. By 2003, all but 27 of these couples had conceived. Another IQ test was given to each set of parents successful in conceiving and birthing a baby six months after their child was born. These results were compared to the previous intelligence tests. In every single one of the 173 cases, both parents scored at least twelve points lower on the second IQ test, with the majority of parents losing twenty or more IQ points. Dr. Hosung Lee, director of the study, was not surprised with the findings. “The research proved that our hypothesis was correct. Having children does retard one’s brain activity, and since both parents lost intelligence, we must assume that this loss has a psychological rather than biological cause.” The IQ tests show that when a child is born, the part of the brain that makes one think objectively takes the biggest hit when it comes to losing brainpower. “This explains why every parent thinks their child is the smartest kid in class or the best athlete, even if that child is as dumb as a box of rocks or needs a calendar to time their forty-yard dash. People who before were intelligent and open-minded turn into raving lunatics who want to blame a teacher or coach every time their mediocre child fails,” said Lee. Lee says the Kinsey Institute will continue to test the couples participating in the study to determine if the loss of intelligence is reversible once children grow up and leave the nest and if parents who continue having children lose even more intelligence"

I can't help feeling the parent's lack of sleep after six months with a newborn influenced their IQ scores. I would like to see the scores when the kids become more independent like around 12 years or so. I think it is rather silly to equate irrational behavior with the loss of 20 IQ points. I bet those parents who think their children can do no wrong and actually fight with others about it were irrational to begin with no matter what their IQ score. High IQ does not equal rationality.

I'm sure since some parents don't get the mental stimulation that single, career-minded adults get, I could see some truth to this. But I think it's a pretty small study to really make an overall conclusion. I have a highly intelligent child (our oldest), so I have to stay on top of my game just to keep up with him!

Lot's of things can factor IQ scores besides just the actual having of the child. The staying at home raising them for a long time and not having the stimulation to the brain you used to have might be one. Another might be the stress that they go through. I would have to agree with Rache(no a coorect)l here on the fact that them getting retested after the child has grown enough to not need constant supervision would change the score again. It is an interesting thought to think it might have an effect though.

The study doesn't say what it is about being a parent that drops the IQ, but what you've said could account for it. I know it's not the embryology and birth process itself. The study could not be saying that, since men don't give birth. What happens to a man's sperm does not have a direct biological effect in his body.

My brother is so funny. Wait a minute, perhaps I am unable to be objective about this. Perhaps having a brother lowers your IQ.

I have two brothers and two sisters. In the future instead of expecting you to read my livejournal where they are repeatedly mentioned, I will send you a gold-plated press release. ;^)

I wish they would've also done the IQ test on the childless couples, just for the control sample. Personally, I feel dumber every day and I don't have kids. :)

Someone posted that article in the Detroit NK community on Yahoo, but then later announced that the story was bogus. Did you find this on www.hoosiergazette.com ?

It might not necessarily destroy your IQ to have children, but it does keep you from bettering yourself. My friends who have children are so frazzled all the time. They are not as sociable as they were before, when it comes to going out. They never seem to have the time to take new classes, go to see a play, go to a museum, etc. You can see where I am going with this. Even getting married or just being in a committed relationship starts to diminish your personal growth time, because its not just you anymore. You have to account for your partner. Now add 1-3 kids, and count your life goodbye. Don't get me wrong, I think having children is an important thing. The human race depends on this. However, this bring me to a second revelation...mostly stupid people are breeding! The smart, intelligent people are not having kids for the exact reason I just mentioned. The one's that are breeding are the people that need more money from welfare, don't have any direction in life, etc. Just drive through the bad areas of town, and you'll see what I am talking about.
