One of you pointed me to the new [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/) web application. I like it. Is anyone else among you using it? Now if only it could export the calendar and the Gmail contacts for my handheld computer, I'll be all set.

Hell, no. Give Google all my schedule information for them to retain forever and use however they feel like it (or cough up to the government when asked)?

Dude... If you're that paranoid, feed it false info, so you always have an alibi.

Dave, Brittany and I are all using it to coordinate the household schedule. Yes, there's a lot of Google Paranoia out there. If the government really cares that the kitten has a vet appointment, they're welcome to the info. My life isn't that exciting.
