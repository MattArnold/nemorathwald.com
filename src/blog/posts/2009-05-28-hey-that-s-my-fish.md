The board game "Hey! That's My Fish!" is now available as a downloadable Wii Ware. Attention and . Big B and Little B may be interested to know. As for me, I prefer the look and feel of the [physical version](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8203), but at $8, this costs considerably less than the $30 wood and cardboard game. Relevant gameplay begins in 1:53 of the video.

Why, thank you, Matt! I showed it to them and they both said, "Cool" and "Awesome"!
