Daily Show Resident Expert [John Hodgman](http://areasofmyexpertise.blogspot.com/), (who'll you may recognize as "Hi, I'm a PC" from the Apple commercials) and Traveling Troubador [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) (who I blogged about last night) seem to have some kind of co-promotional partnership, constantly mentioning each other in their blogs, and touring together. They'll appear at the Borders Books And Music on Liberty in downtown Ann Arbor on Wednesday, October 4 at 7PM. However, the only way Coulton will give a concert later that night is [if we all go to Eventful and ask for it.](http://eventful.com/performers/P0-001-000000067-4/demand)

Barenaked Ladies are going to be at Borders at noon that day. It's going to be worse than a Football Saturday downtown.
