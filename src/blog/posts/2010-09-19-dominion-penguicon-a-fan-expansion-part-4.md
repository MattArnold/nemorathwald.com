Click for more detail, because I spent a very long time on this one. [![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TJZe0FtYGlI/AAAAAAAAIJY/_amwgOtwajs/s400/AegisCard.jpg)](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GdBVHOYGLeJLFvkP379U4A?feat=directlink) This is the only card that costs two potions at the same time. It's difficult to get your first copy. But once you've got it, it builds on itself by cleaning out the potions you used to buy it in the first place. Sal is the only card able to produce two potions, so you can get one of these each time you use him. But if you get an Aegis that way, you'll still probably buy a potion or two in order to come out on top of the pecking order, because this card works best in groups. A strategy that relies on this card can win the game-- but it's most likely to succeed if you don't do much of anything else. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TI0w3XiCO_I/AAAAAAAAIIw/drulOFeAwGw/s400/SteveCard.jpg) The arbitrage card. Steve saves all the coins you didn't spend this turn, and all the Action points which you didn't use to play Action cards on this turn. You get them on your next turn. You will start to play Dominion more carefully, like this: "Do I really want to play all these extra Actions just because they're in my hand? What would that accomplish? I've already got more than enough money to buy the card I want. I'll save the rest for next turn." If you play two copies of this, you double that benefit. So it's like accruing interest. I can't describe this card without using words like "accrue" and "arbitrage".[

### For more Penguicon cards, continue to part five!

Of course it would make sense that you would know the Aegis folks, but the fact that you do just made my brain go 'splodey. Had some interesting times with them 12-15 years ago.

I hereby deny that I would EVER use a two handed grip while using a shield. ....is that supposed to be a flamberge blade? :) Excellent job, but I wish I knew Dominion rules well enough to understand the significance of the card.

Let it be duly noted in the record. :) That is intended to be a two-handed longsword-- made out of duct-tape. I did just enough research to be dangerous, but bowed to dramatic license on quite a few points throughout the illustration.

Hmm.... I think I could have done much worse. :) I don't mind being associated with "accrue" and "arbitrage". And you got the cocked eyebrow down. Thank you, sir!
