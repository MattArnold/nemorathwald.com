Disclaimer 1: This is an unofficial fan-made expansion to the card game Dominion. All rights to Dominion are the publisher Rio Grande Games and the designer Donald X. Vaccarino. Disclaimer 2: Some of these have not been playtested and will certainly need to be tweaked. Want to playtest them? Disclaimer 3: These have to be fun cards to play with. In order to be fun and worthwhile, a Dominion card must do enough awesome things to be worth choosing during the game, but with some kind of disadvantage to create interesting choices during gameplay. Nothing personal. Also every card has to be limited or it gets boring. For instance, the Zrnich card turns it into a drinking game, but I had to limit it by making it a card of the Attack type. Limey as an attack? He doesn't attack. That doesn't make any sense thematically. But it had to be done or everyone might pass out and fall under the table in a single turn. I have about a dozen more awaiting only their illustrations. Here are the first five. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/THwQ5HNVlBI/AAAAAAAAIFE/yasi5BXacJw/s400/MOATNCard.jpg) House rule is that you don't have to remove the item of clothing if you don't want to. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/THwQ5ETJPAI/AAAAAAAAIFI/PtTe_RvB-SE/s400/RobCard.jpg) It's like victory points are Nifties and Guests of Honor. Rob's specialty. Rob is the only person I know who I think could get us Mark Shuttleworth. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/THwQ4-B0VEI/AAAAAAAAIE8/kr3XNyDXKg0/s400/ChuckCard.jpg) I can't wait to play with this card. Chuck meticulously obsesses over the choicest ingredients to add to his pressure cooker. It takes time, but the payoff is the best turn you could possibly take. Or, if there's lots of bad stuff floating around, he lets you vent it all at once and blow past it. In honor of alcoholic celebrations, the price of Chuck includes a potion. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/THwQ49IMMfI/AAAAAAAAIE4/Ezt9Tw-iv9w/s400/BillCard.jpg) Dominion cards are supposed to attack everyone equally. In defiance of that custom, this one is explicitly political. It turns everyone at the table against another player. ![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/THwdbM6C28I/AAAAAAAAIFg/2JuddvYpRCQ/s400/JerCard.jpg) You can get any card on the table if you don't mind making everyone around you powerful. But you can gain a tiny card in order to inflict a Copper or Curse on everyone. Because what would a Jer card be without Cursing?[

### For more Penguicon cards, continue to part two!

Can't wait to see what the Aegis card does.

I'd love to, but I planned to name them after specific people, who are pictured on the card. Who exactly is Aegis these days?

He's not exactly tied to Aegis in the strictest sense, but you could do Sal.

This is awesome, and I can;t wait to play with these cards.

Hah! I laughed my ass off. Well done on all! I now want to play with this expansion :)

Hey, what are the legal ramifications of making an expansion available? Meaning, is this something sell-able?

**[ext_21159](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_21159)** on Sep. 1, 2010 4:58 PM

I could not turn it into a business. Legally and ethically, Dominion includes a set of blank cards for this purpose. I picked up many packs at GenCon.

Oh, not entirely what I meant. I'll tap you offline about this...I has plans!!

The "kilted alex" card is the only card that can remove Jer from play. "Mr Lance, the hotel heard about what you did with that tree.. you need to leave now" :-P
