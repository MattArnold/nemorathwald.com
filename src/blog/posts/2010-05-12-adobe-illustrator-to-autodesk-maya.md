The Maya 3D animation instructor has no idea how happy he is making me right now. I'm an expert in Adobe Illustrator, which creates vector art in 2D. I have often wished that I could take my beautiful, precise, intricate Illustrator drawings into 3D software to lathe or extrude them into 3D-- or even connect two curves to turn them into the opposite edges of a curved 3D surface. He's showing the class how to import from Illustrator right now!

So you could actually make a 3d model of your U-Con cover from 2009? That would be tre-cool!

The easiest way to do that would be to make an icosahedron and wrap an image on it. The very next class taught me how to do that! However, if I used the technique I told you about in this blog post, it would be even cooler. I could take the Adobe Illustrator curves of the continental edges, and extrude them up off of the surface of the icosahedron!
