At this week's board meeting of my hackerspace, we finally were able to take a vote on the ventilation safety dispute between the baby boomer craft show ladies in Jewelry and the Gen-Z craft show ladies in Ceramics, who had been engaged in an escalating cycle of passive-aggressive backstabbing for weeks. None of which they engaged in when I was personally present, so they tended to call me in to mediate. They drew up a new floor plan map and it resolved very well.

At the Board meeting, suddenly a dark horse! The glass kiln, homeless and championless, suddenly had enthusiasts who were emotionally invested???????? One of them, Lauren, volunteered to champion it but agreed we could proceed with the overall kiln ventilation vote and deal with it afterward. Others of them tried to complicate matters of kiln ventilation. As always, the meeting threatened to bog down in the dreaded BOREDOM. This went on for a long time. I insisted on tabling it until after resolving the actual concrete actionable measure on the actual agenda. After the Board finally voted on that proposal, the following is not exactly what I said to conclude the Board meeting, and finalize weeks of hard work from jewelry and ceramics. It's not exactly what I said, but it didn't need to be said. Something about the moment was very ceremonial.

...unless there are any further plot twists, such as a Pirate curse placed on the jewelry zone's gold,

then by the power vested in gathering in this building, the place that all of this is about,

and the power vested in the bylaws, so it is written, and the standing rules, so it is written,

and the power vested in me as President,

and the power vested in our norms, which are more like guidelines really,

then we have an accord,

and I declare the baby-boomer/Gen-Z dispute of 2023 is ... RESOLVED!

Next order of business! Before we vote. Lauren \[------\]. Two questions for you. First. Do you agree to be symbolically connected to all saints which may or may not be associated with glass and/or glass-working, if any? Do you agree to champion the homeless glass kiln, secure in the trust that others here will provide for it by sacrificing from their floor plan? Who on the board votes to designate Lauren as the symbolic representative of all working and sciences of substances that are glass? of its fusing? and of its slumping? Any opposed? The motion passes unanimously.

Lauren, please take this cowbell. I want you to be the one to ring it. This exact cowbell has been rung to close every meeting since this organization was founded in 2009. It is a symbol. When we offer to ring it, what that means is that those who do not yet feel heard, speak now, or agree to feel heard next time. And when it rings what it means is, may there be a next time! To there being a next time!

We live in cities you never see on screen

not very pretty but we sure know how to run things

living in ruins of a palace within my dreams

and you know we're on each other's team
