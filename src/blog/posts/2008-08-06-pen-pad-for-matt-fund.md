![](http://z.about.com/d/graphicssoft/1/G/w/x/4/Aiptek-Slim-Tablet.jpg)**Q. Why should I tip you a few bucks?** A. So I can replace my old broken [pen pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_tablet). **Q. So?** A. It could be that you simply wish to see more drawings, and there won't be any as long as I have an ancient discount-brand tablet that gets increasingly non-functional by the minute. The tales to come include: "Rootless Root, the Unix Koans of Master Foo" by Eric Raymond An original graphic novella, working title "Mindarium" **Q. Hmm... if I give you a sheep, would you give me an ore and two wheat?** But wait, there's more! Using the new tablet, I will email each donor a line-art sketch of their own request, and blog it (with permission). Each multiple of $5 from one donor would receive an additional sketch. Each frame of a comic strip is considered one sketch. But wait, there's more than just quantity. For donors above $10, you don't even need to come up with your own idea-- I'll invent one or more of them myself if you want. _A super value!_ Donors above $15 receive greyscale paintings. Donors above $20 receive full color. Paypal

You might want to tell people what a pen pad is, or link to one.
