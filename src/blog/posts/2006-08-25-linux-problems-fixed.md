The computer on which I run Linux had a hardware problem and wouldn't boot up; took it and fixed it in half an hour by resetting the BIOS chip. Thanks, ! I've also had a software problem for months: the [Firefox web browser](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) wouldn't start. Even uninstalling and reinstalling it didn't fix this. I logged on to [the chat channel](http://www.ubuntu.com/support/free) of [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and within half an hour the friendly folks there had identified the problem and took me step-by-step through setting things right. Somehow [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) was living in a directory called "firefox" when it was expected to be living in a directory called "mozilla-firefox". All my buttons and menu items that were supposed to open this application were looking for it in the wrong place. The [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) free tech support volunteers helped me create a symbolic link, so that when the buttons looked in the wrong place they'd be directed to the right place; since then all has been well. Thanks, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) volunteer folks! The good reputation of this "Linux for Human Beings" distribution is well-deserved!

I just installed Ubuntu Desktop on a Microsoft Virtual PC virtual hard drive on my work laptop about a week ago. Amazingly, it just works. I don't use it a lot except to fool around with it but it works very well. I'm rather impressed by it so far. Next step is to scrounge up a cheap PC to install it straight out. Maybe two PC's to add as a server.

Web browsing, instant messaging, listening to music, watching movies, word processing, spreadsheets, recording and sound-engineering my podcast-- I do pretty much everything with the point-and-click desktop under Ubuntu Linux, except for desktop publishing and games. (I'm highly invested in Adobe software, although I also use their equivalents on Linux.)
