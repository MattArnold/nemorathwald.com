[PZ Myers says](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/11/this_is_an_experiment.php):

> Acephalous is trying to [measure the rate of propagation of links across the net](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/measuring_the_s.html). He's asking everyone to link to [his post](http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/measuring_the_s.html) (so this may just be shameless blog-whoring under the guise of doing science), exhort our readers to do likewise, and he's going to be monitoring its movement through Technorati, and will report the results at the MLA meetings. So you heard me. Get on your blog, link to http://acephalous.typepad.com/acephalous/2006/11/measuring\_the\_s.html, and let's see how quickly we can saturate the blogosphere.
