My dad has a TV adapter card now, and has started putting our old home videos on YouTube. As a child, I adapted the story "Many Moons" by James Thurber into a stage play. I was the King, my brother Jon was the Jester, and my sister was the Princess.

I think this video goes to show that you haven't changed a bit -- still creative with a dramatic flair, and the strange ability to co-opt everyone you know into your projects. Oh, and need I mention you're still awesome? ;P
