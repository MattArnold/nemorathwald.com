has a friend who enjoys posting silly horoscopes from an entertaining astrologer named Brezny. "Free Will Astrology" is a horoscope column that doesn't treat astrology like prophecy; Brezny gives out generic advice and inspiration that he feels would be good for anyone. It's like receiving a randomized assignment in feeling good and thinking about your life, I guess. laughed when she recognized [something in Gemini about the college I attended](http://www.freewillastrology.com/horoscopes/20060713.html): _"**Gemini** (May 21-June 20) Florida's Pensacola Christian College has a strict code of conduct that regulates the interaction of male and female students. One of the forbidden acts is "optical intercourse," also known as "making eye babies." This occurs when two people gaze into each other's eyes too long and too deeply. Luckily, you don't attend Pensacola Christian College, and will thus face no prohibitions if you choose to carry out my astrological advice: Make eye babies in abundance during the coming week. This is the best time in eons for you to build soul-to-soul intimacy with those who've earned your exuberant trust. P.S. If you don't have a lover with whom you want to make eye babies, do it with a good friend, with a favorite animal, or with yourself in a mirror."_ That [article in the Chronicle of Higher Education](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/122688.html) which I contributed an interview to has obviously been making the rounds all over the internet.

This cracks me up. I'm so glad that guy wrote the article and that we helped like we did. :)

Yeah, that whole "making eye babies" thing is a hoot. But what I find more unbelievable is that the kids actually allow someone to dictate who and how long they can look at someone. Do the kids have a "quickie" with their teacher when they make eye contact in class!
