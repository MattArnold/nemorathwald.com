played "[Skullcrusher Mountain](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/skullcrusher-mountain)" for me, and Scalzi had me listen to "[Code Monkey](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/code-monkey)", "[Mandelbrot Set](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/mandelbrot-set)" and "[Re: Your Brain](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/re-your-brains)" on his iPod. These songs by [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) were enough to make me ask Lady Sarah to please see if there is _any way_ Coulton would like to perform at [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/). I've been listening to [his free samples](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs) and buying his music all day, and have transformed into a fan eager to tell _everyone I know_. Some of his music is genuinely tender and touching, while remaining... weird. Consider for instance, his [song from the point of view of Pluto's moon Charon](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/im-your-moon). I can see them in my minds' eye holding hands, spinning around and around each other. Other songs are hilarious. Listen to ["Podsafe Christmas Song"](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/podsafe-christmas-song) if you want to laugh. The lyrics are just the tip of the iceberg of what's funny about it: We want a podsafe Christmas song We want a song that’s safe to play Don’t think us rude We don’t want to get sued By the thugs at the RIAA We have been good the whole year long Santa don’t delay Give us a podsafe Christmas song To celebrate Christmas day

Jonathan Coulton kicks unholy ass. I got to meet him and watch him do his thing at Confluence a couple months back, and traded CDs with him. He's so friggin' genuine in his creepiness, inny? :) -=ShoEboX=-

Why are you waiting for Penguicon? What's he doing in October and January?

I thought of "[Moonbase ConFusion](http://www.stilyagi.org/cons/2007/)" while listening to "[I'm Your Moon](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/im-your-moon)"!

This must be the same Jonathan Coulton that hosts the [Popsci Podcast](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/whatsnew/2a97225814a2b010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html). I've been a subscriber for a while, not only for the interesting news, but also so that I can rock out to his bumper jingle. I never heard of the guy in any other context, so thanks.
