I've been considering posting my resume to a public LJ entry, but that might poison potential employers against me if they see it and it's not ... shall we say euphemistically, _tailored_ to them. Some of you already totally understand. To the rest, please try to understand. I apologize for the tantrum. I grant that it's wrong of me to speculate on the motives of HR people or anyone else, and I will refrain from it no matter how I feel in the future. They themselves are not the reason that _the way they phrase things_ makes me feel demotivated. I feel frustrated because I _do_ want to care, just about things other than are listed in their job listing, and am not yet prepared to. I'm like an amputee at a race where everyone keeps telling me to get out there on the track. That would sour anybody on those people, real quick. Amputee? I'm no defeatist. I'm intelligent, creative, and optimistic. I'm aiming to triumph. That doesn't mean I don't know the seriousness of the position I'm in! Innate talent and interest are not enough to work in the field that one cares about; it requires qualifications such as education and experience. Although I list my unaccredited diploma on my resume, a Commercial Art degree has little to do with my current goals. My work experience thus far has been in areas where there either exists no viable market in Detroit and Ann Arbor, or in which I have no interest. So during the interim of years in which I prepare (or try to) for my long-term plan (crossing my fingers and hoping there's a viable market for it when I'm done), I will have to take jobs I don't want in order to pay my bills. I don't get the option to pick and choose which jobs I apply for. \* I understand that the employers at those interim companies are not going to want to hear that, and I understand what motivates them, and I understand they don't owe me a job. But I also feel frustration at the catch-22 that creates for me. Hence the strong emotion. My resume reads "Objective: to solve fresh challenges in print and computer media that take advantage of my creativity and expertise". Set aside for a moment the insincere-sounding resume language in which that is written. (At least it comes across that way to me.) The  graphic designer temp agency consistently assures me the market in this region is saturated, which is why I settled for the last job they gave me in a different position. I haven't had any work experience in this other than freelancing in three years, which further reduces my chances in that area. And besides, that reflects what I was trained in, not my current goals. When I apply for another job, **I'm going to have to change that line on my resume** to match the job I'm applying for-- whatever job I can get in this economy-- and that will make me feel like a rat bastard faker. How would you feel schlepping yourself around to people who you know don't want you? What would you do? \*Some of you can't relate to being in that position. Congratulations on having been a good strategist, talent agent, and business manager to yourself. I aim to become one too, but I'm just getting started and that skill set is still shaky.

Why would potential employers be reading your blog? And, not only that, they'd have to spend some time looking for you specifically. After having just googled your name, there are plenty of different Matt and Matthew Arnolds out there. Seems like more effort than needed personally. And, I don't see any reason they would? And, why should that poison them against your credentials? Just because one version of your resume isn't what they want?

According to numerous articles in the last year or so, Google has become the method du jour of employers to look up employees before inviting someone to a job interview. My homepage is the first thing that comes up when you Google "Matt Arnold", which has my blog mirrored on it; my livejournal page itself is on the first page.

See, I didn't " " your name. \*sheepish look\* Your googlefu is better than mine. I still haven't heard of anybody having that problem though when job hunting. But, that's just me. I still wish you the best of luck!

To thine own self be true. And to your friends and loved ones. Outside of that circle, it's a carny act, pure and simple. Every HR person expects that the claims of experience on a person's resume will be inflated, and the objective of an interview is to determine just how much spin has been created. Look at this as a multi-level video game. You have to solve the first objective (mollify the HR gate keeper), to get to the next level (impress your potential manager), to the real goal -- acquiring the job. So, yes, you'll need to tailor your resume. It's a piece of creative writing, that is a piece of advertising for you. Like any other piece of creative writing, knowing your audience is going to determine how you write.

I would say no. Recently (last 6 months or so) I had read an article in one of my woman's magazines about companies that are googling potential employees. One candidate for a company had a my space account and when the potential employer looked at the site - did not like what they saw - and that was just the work related stuff that she mentioned on her site. Your personal and your professional life in regards to employers should be kept separate. If after you get hired and are comfortable with the people - that's the time to share a blog, but not before then. Of course this is my own opinion, but I live it to. Work knows I blog but I've never shared my id or site with them. Of course the IT guys \*can\* get that information from our network, but no reason they should. Besides I work for a \*great\* company

While I agree in theory, I think a blog that a public blog that reflects positively upon the applicant might even be a good thing - a sort of self-promotion, especially in a digital-type business. I don't think I'd go so far as to create a faux blog to be captured by search engines... but the idea sounds kinda fun, even if it is evil. :D

I'd keep your blog and your resume separate. I know it has never been an issue for me but I've decided lately to omit work stuff from my blog. Some of its superstition, some of its because I don't think its the proper venue to discuss the workplace. I know you have some of your work posted on your website, you might want to focus on making that your showcase for work stuff. I understand about not having your career figured out yet. I've been trying to get out of the rut I've been since I graduated from college in 2001.

I'm a big fan of the blog/internet life seprate from my businessey/scholastic image.

I wouldn't post my resume to LJ. Post it on your personal site, that's a good idea. I think you could even include your current objective, but elaborate it in some fashion to explain that you are looking for an interesting/challenging/rewarding/etc job that will keep you on the path toward your long-term goal of... and whatnot. (: Honesty is okay. "I'm looking for a rewarding position" is completely true. Bitterness ("I am looking for something rewarding and I believe there is no possible way you can provide it") won't get anyone very far. Finally, what somebody was saying about being professional... I think that essentially means that you take pride and pleasure in doing your job and doing it well. Whatever it may be... making a commitment and seeing it through. Anyway, I'm sure this is a frustrating time for you. I hope "talking" it out on lj helps some... Good luck!

How would you feel schlepping yourself around to people who you know don't want you? What would you do?" I have a different perspective. You have many goals, don't you? The point of a resume is to interest someone in the idea of you (particularly you in a given position, but most especially just you) enough to get you into a face-to-face interview. Now, if you said "My goal is to become the best administrative assistant I could possibly be!" ... well, then you could call yourself a rat-bastard faker. I really don't think it is so terribly difficult (or such a terrible act) for a person to write up a goal that is reasonable and leads an interviewer in the right direction towards believing you will behave a certain way (in which you actually intend to behave). I see no shame in that.

Heh, one has to go EIGHT pages into google to find anything related to me, and that's just a simple deadend at my workplace. On the other hand.... searching for my LJ-name brings up pages and pages of stuff, all me. Including a post in an ex's journal about the first day we hung out together. Weird, innit?

**[ext_344389](https://www.dreamwidth.org/users/ext_344389)** on Jan. 10, 2007 4:56 AM

Don't post it. If you're number one on Google, it will come back and bite you. You are not going to like this, but I wouldn't be a friend if I didn't say it. If I were you I would lock my blog down to friends only until you find work. I agree with many of your your views, but mr./ms. mundane in HR might not see eye to eye with mnay of your views on religion, politics, social issues or possibly even your schooling. If you would like, e-mail me your resume. I've hired lots of people over the years and I can give you a rough idea of what works and what does not. This would give me a chance to thank you for the Wiki advice.

Or....find what you love and what you are good at and make a career out of it. Working for yourself. To heck with a bunch of overly sensitive H.R. folk. Many of them which don't have a clue about what to look for in an employee other than the standard...do they have a degree....do they have any gaps in their resume....how do they look....do they look like someone who would fit in etc. Hiring someone (which I have done many times) requires being able to see beyond the obvious. Most good H.R. people can sniff out a lie on a resume or see beyond some personal things listed on the web. Your views are what they are....they will come out at some point. Better to simply be yourself up front. If the people wanting to hire you don't like it...then your better off not there anyway.
