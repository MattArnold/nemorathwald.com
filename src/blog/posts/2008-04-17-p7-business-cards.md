This is to hand out this weekend, to make sure that anyone who might help or present at Penguicon 7.0 in 2009 knows how to get in touch with me and has a physical reminder to do so. Only $10 for 250.

You are going to have an identity crisis after next year's convention.

Is this the official announcement of 7.0 dates?

I want people to know about the choice of weekend, for planning purposes; but I was going to unveil the hotel and Guests of Honor on Sunday. That having been said: I don't mind word of mouth.
