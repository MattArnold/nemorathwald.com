Using only [Minecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), a team of fans [reproduced the fantastic undersea city](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNxcxnKYPOc) from the computer game Bioshock! :) The folks in the Lojban community have a multiplayer Minecraft server as well, at pinfu.lojban.org. kunkakpa is Lojban for Minecraft. We're sort of setting out to label everything in the world with signs in Lojban.
