Hi there, Matt! I believe I met you briefly at Confusion the other day, I was at the "your first con" panel. Of course, you're going to have to take me on my word for this, given the relative anonymity of Livejournal as a whole, but I enjoyed talking to you. Do you have a friending policy in regards to your LJ? I'm trying to follow rules of blog netiquette before I randomly friend you. Just wanted to drop you a note and say hello!

I hope you enjoyed ConFusion, JewelEyes. (I was sitting to Matt's right on that panel.)

I have no friending policy, so go ahead! Good to hear from you.

I can't believe I functioned at work today. My power is running out.
