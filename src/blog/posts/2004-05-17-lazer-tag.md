I had fun Friday night. DJ Blasted Bill invited me at the last minute to Lazer Tag. Twelve people showed up and we had fun. I got there early, and to my surprise, I discovered [Anna](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/ConFusion_2004.htm) is employed there. At first I called her by the name of another girl I know from Con who looks very similar. That was embarrasing. Nine of us sat around outside waiting for the three who actually arranged the activity to show up, and it occured to me to wish that I had my copy of [Morton's List](http://www.mortonslist.com/) with me. So from now on I'm keeping it in the trunk of my car. I rated nineteen out of twenty at Lazer Tag because I paid no attention to the instructions, which said I had to hold the gun with both hands. So it didn't actually fire. :^) Afterwards we went to Ram's Horn. At one point I started a game of Telephone, with the phrase "Cheese and rice got dandruff and some of it itches." Everybody got various expressions on their faces as it was whispered into their ears down the table, due to its unlikeliness and its phonetic resemblance to "Jesus Christ God- d @ mn s 0 ns of b 1 tches." (I'm editing it in case nanny-filters would block this page.) Some of the more Mundane members of the group momentarily grappled with whether or not to pass it on at all. Despite their careful enunciation, by the time it reached back to me, it had become "Cheese are rice are dangerous and so is Jesus Christ." How interesting...
