After serving as a gateway into the board game hobby, Settlers of Catan gets boring. I propose many of the issues would be fixed by replacing the dice with a deck of cards with 1 through 6 on them. Instead of rolling two dice and summing them, draw two cards and sum them. One of the things for which you can pay with your resources is to put a new copy of a card in the deck, or remove one. If you've built all your settlements on high numbers, or low numbers, or evens, or odds, you try to get more of those into the deck. I haven't played Settlers in years, but now I want to try it again.

Settlers has a deck of cards you can buy to use instead of dice, I have a set.

That sounds like a fascinating idea. I'd be up for giving it a try sometime!

Great! Yesterday I made the number cards. Now, to figure out how much it should cost to add or remove a card.

Really? What's the title of the product? I'd like to look it up on Boardgamegeek.com.

I have that set of cards as well. You could also use a set of double six dominoes with the blanks removed.
