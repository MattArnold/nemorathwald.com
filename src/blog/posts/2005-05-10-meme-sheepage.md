### The Keys to Your Heart

You are attracted to those who have a split personality - cold as ice on the outside but hot as fire in the heart. **_\- What exactly does this mean?_**

In love, you feel the most alive when your partner is patient and never willing to give up on you. **_\- Certainly not. Although all the same, that is what I've got._**

You'd like to your lover to think you are stylish and alluring. **_\- As opposed to... what?_**

You would be forced to break up with someone who was insecure and in constant need of reassurance. **_Yes, but I'll make an exception once a month. :)_**

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with. **_\- That would be unrealistic and unwise._**

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment. **_True, but that's why I try to minimize the commitments I make. By the way, sex is not what's wrong with cheating, it's the LYING. If you can't keep the deal, just break up. (Has anyone ever scored differently on this question?)_**

You think of marriage as something that will confine you. You are afraid of marriage. **_\- Yes._**

In this moment, you think of love as something you can get or discard anytime. You're feeling self centered. **_\- Yes._**

Yeppers! That's why I didn't bother with \*that\* particular meme this time around. Many of those points get answered with your "As opposed to... what?" They're all pretty silly, but this one was a waste of time.

Heh. I haven't had the time to go around and deliberatly see what the other options are, but the person I pulled it from got several answers which were different from mine, so I know it has more than one option.
