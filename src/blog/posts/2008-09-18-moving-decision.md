I might move in with J in her apartment in Ypsilanti. There are arguments to be made for and against. It's a difficult decision and one that has been pondered for months. By no means is this a decision entered lightly or quickly. 

**More Serious Pros:**

**More Serious Cons:**

**rent-free, not owing R any more rent money**

**less than perfect wireless internet**

**a job market I haven't tapped out**

**farther from friends and collaborators**

**not getting kicked out whenever R's new guy visits (I'm almost living here already)**

**no more than two or three guests at a time**

**extended deadline to find somewhere I can afford**

**farther from post office to ship PodDisc.com, Bookmooch.com and eBay.com items twice weekly**

Less Important Pros:

More Managable Cons:

public transportation

farther from ceramic kiln

a room of my own

higher requirements about cooking, laundry, shoes, bathtub mat, towels, music and dishes

podcasting without bird noises

if J's husband moves back next year, he doesn't want to live with me, so I'd be out

library within walking distance that has been letting me set up a complete desktop computer, for that "I'm in the workplace and must work now" phenomenon

wearing down J's social energy with my high energy (effect appears to have acclimated now)

may hang my Epcot and Science Fiction paintings on the wall

painful religious discussions

not accidentally damaging any more of R's stuff

farther from the Novi Apple Store if I get the job there

humongous gasoline savings from not driving between Hazel Park and Ypsilanti so often

no small yellow bird

finally completing five years of gradual migration toward Washtenaw

Distances from the Crowne Plaza, the Penguicon storage cube, and Castle Bradaki are comparable. Am I missing a factor?

There's an Apple Store in Ann Arbor at the mall... maybe 5 miles from J's place... would you be able to transfer? The Post Office thing... it's not THAT far, is it? And would that not be doable with public transit? You're not shipping THAT much, are you? J's husband moving back and therefore you having to move out is only minor?

_There's an Apple Store in Ann Arbor at the mall... maybe 5 miles from J's place... would you be able to transfer?_ There's no telling, as I don't even have a job at any of them yet, but the Novi one is the one with the person who wants to hire me. _The Post Office thing... it's not THAT far, is it? And would that not be doable with public transit? You're not shipping THAT much, are you?_ It's no longer within walking distance as the Hazel Park one was. _J's husband moving back and therefore you having to move out is only minor?_ Yes. (1) I already have to move out of where I already am, and this sets that off a year. (2) It might not even happen, ever. (3) It involves no drama.

My friend Ben Karl works at the Novi Store. Or did, last I checked.

All understandable. :) Good luck.

I think it's really sweet that the distance to the Castle B was a factor that you considered. I have nothing new to add, just wanted to tell you that I hope you can come to a good decision soon.
