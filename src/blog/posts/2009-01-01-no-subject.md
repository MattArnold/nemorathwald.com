Using the gift card my grandfather gave me for Christmas, I bought a new espresso machine on sale. The old one was no longer heating adequately, producing weak, lukewarm steam.

In other news, a friend of Lojbab visited Michigan and stopped by my house to drop off sixty-four copies of [_The Complete Lojban Language_](http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+Complete+Lojban+Language) by John Woldemar Cowan. Now I can take over order fulfillment for the Logical Language Group. I've wanted to do that for a long time, but shipping them from Philadelphia to me was prohibitively expensive. Enough inventory was produced in 1997 that our inventory still numbers in the hundreds. [The mention of Lojban in xkcd](http://xkcd.com/191/) was probably our biggest public exposure ever, and accelerated sales, but it's still not fast enough for me. I would like to sell out the first edition so I can do the graphic design and illustration on the second edition, and incorporate all the errata that has been discovered over the years. I wonder, what other venues can I look at to sell this book?

If people know there's an improved second edition in the works, you may have trouble selling the first edition.

There is no work being done on a second edition. There is merely an errata sheet. There's not going to be any point in starting work on a second edition for a few years, as the LLG intends to not publish a second edition until we've sold out the first one. I'm not sure how to overcome this unavoidable Catch-22. The solution may involve [Fundable.com](http://fundable.com/) in some way, but I have not yet figured out how.

Hey, how much are they going for? I might like a copy.

$39 if I can hand it off to you in person, or an extra $6 for shipping.

Ok, cool. I'll most likely run into you at Penguicon!
