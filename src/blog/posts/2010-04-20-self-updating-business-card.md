While pondering business cards, I recalled [the biography of myself in 2019](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/260133.html) which the game [Superstruct](http://www.superstructgame.org/) required for my profile. I liked the business card I described there. Therefore, I have decided to print some. ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/S80nOP_rymI/AAAAAAAAH9s/i8luM5yxhuo/s400/MattArnoldSocialGraphBusinessCard.gif)

Google Goggles is uninformative about what this means, and I have no other means handy to interpret a 2D barcode...

My QR code reader (iPhone app) says it's Matt's name, email address, and phone number.

I would suggest printing a simple set of instructions either on the front or the back.

neat! also, skennedy may be correct about the instructions. no telling who has and hasn't seen those things before, or know how to work them.

I'd say no need for instructions since you replicate the information right there on the card as well. Either they know what to do with the QR code or not. If not, odds are they're not going to go to the trouble to find out what it is. If they do, and they go to the effort to install an app and find out it's the same info, I'd think they'd be hacked off. And I say this as someone who has a QR code on my business card. But my QR code also includes a URL link to my online resume and includes a job title which isn't on the business card itself. So I'm hoping that the bit of extra content makes them feel better about any extra effort they may have exerted.

OK, I guess that isn't the one on your business card. ;-)

My original plan was to link to my LinkedIn profile, but unfortunately, the ability to make my profile public is a paid feature.

You might want to double check that. I'm pretty sure my profile is public with a friendly URL even and I don't have a paid account. Although I guess it depends on how you define public. If I provide the link people can see it, and there's a button for them to see my full profile. Not sure if they need to be connected to me or just have a linkedin account to see the full profile.
