![](http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/Images/the_church_of_google.gif) From time to time, I receive a response to my entry on [exchristian.org](http://exchristian.org/). Here's the latest:

Have you considered God outside of religion?

* * *

Yes, depending on what you mean. Perhaps we might invent a godlike being using artificial intelligence someday. Who knows? I guess we'll just have to wait and find out. Also, there might exist a godlike being in the universe that started it all off and didn't care about us after that. I can't disprove it, but I see no evidence for it and no need for it. Thanks for writing. -Matt Arnold

Good Morning, What I mean is, each particular religion creates its own God. It does that simply by assigning power and authority to their particular God. When a person doesn't like religion's God they simply find a religion with a God, in which, they can believe.

I take it you don't believe in a Higher Power? That's fair. I believe it foolish to believe in God unless/until God reveals himself. Have Fun..........Be Happy!! BR

Well, I believe in Google. Google answers when I pray to it. :) That's a Higher Power in which I can believe. [Did you ever hear of Googlism](http://www.thechurchofgoogle.org/)? Of course it's a joke, but it has a thought-provoking point. -Matt
