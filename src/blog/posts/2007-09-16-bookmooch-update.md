Have you already read "Ray Kurzweil The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence" since it's on your Previous section? I have a copy (which I picked out of the trash!) that I could lend/give you if you haven't.

No, "previous" means I previously put them on my Wish List and have not found a copy to mooch. I'll take you up on that, thank you!

I've added it to my Book Mooch list -- do you mind "requesting" in there? How about I just bring it with to the next Michigan Lojbanists meeting?
