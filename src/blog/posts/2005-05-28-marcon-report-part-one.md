Here I am at [Marcon](http://www.marcon.org/) in Columbus, Ohio with Bill Putt, Aaron Thul and Davroz. We had a fun and highly computerized road trip. We checked in, registered, and volunteered to be gophers. I am in Consuite keeping a watchful eye on the food table while blogging. I'm two hours into my required twelve hours of work to be compensated my attendance fee. I'm getting lots of comments on the seven ribbon-laden convention badges with which I am festooned. Blog more later- right now I must top off the nachos!

Tell everyone I said Hello. And give Aaron a \*hug\* for me. :)
