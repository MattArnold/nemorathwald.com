Cory Doctorow posted to [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/04/29/timemanagement_for_a.html) today with [Time Management for Anarchists](http://nomediakings.org/vidz/time_management_for_anarchists_the_movie.html), a Flash animation by a productive anarcho-geek. It brought to mind some of the elements in the volunteer-management conversation I had recently with .

Very funny stuff, and useful! When I was in school I used a ratty, duct-taped little 3x5 loose leaf notebook that I fished out of the garbage. With some custom printed calendar and to-do pages and a paper clip indexing system, it helped me to graduate with a GPA that I could be proud of. I've got a Palm PDA now, but I don't feel any more organized. Perhaps it's time to dig out my old faithful.
