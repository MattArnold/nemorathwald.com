I wrote to my main man [Anders Sandberg](http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/), noted Transhumanist scholar from Sweden, to ask him to apply his l33t skillz of data visualization to create the dungeons for my [Lojban Online Roleplaying Adventure](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dg5wbmjw_12fjmvcm). He whipped out a Python script overnight and sent me the PDF the next morning. And of course [he's blogged about it at great length, applying the letter substitution graph to the English language](http://www.aleph.se/andart/archives/2007/01/letter_substitution_graphs_and_percolation_theory.html)! I would like to resume learning Python. What I learned of it from my German Lojban-speaking friend Timonator I understood quite well, and it's pretty cool to know a programming language. It's becoming more useful these days as I spin off more projects that need it. There's a new flashcard program (a sentence-length alternative to Mnemosyne), a game, and a debateware. When we get our debateware up and running, it's going to be released to the world under an open license, and I suspect and hope it will do a lot of good. I will be very proud.

Your third link above points back to your own blog, probably you instead wanted to link to http://www.aleph.se/andart/archives/2007/01/letter\_substitution\_graphs\_and\_percolation\_theory.html. /[kai](http://pointlessanecdotes.blogspot.com/)

Ah, yes; Livejournal defaults to forwarding to itself when the user neglects to include any URL in the tag! \*facepalm\* Thanks.
