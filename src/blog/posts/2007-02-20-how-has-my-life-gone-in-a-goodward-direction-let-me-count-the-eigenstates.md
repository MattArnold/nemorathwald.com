Things have been heading in a goodward direction on many fronts recently. But right now I will tell you about my employment. I have good news and good news. Which one do you want to hear first? Thought so. The good news is I've got a job! It probably starts first thing next week, but I'm getting a crash training session for most of the day Thursday. Then there's the second good news. It's not just any job. It's moving my experience and knowledge in the direction I want to go: the tech industry! I've been thinking of the tech industry as a target for a long time, since most of the projects I'm really interested in managing involve getting people to write software for me; this doesn't usually happen in the print biz. Oh, and there's also a third good news. This is not that situation, which happens so commonly, in which you never know in advance whether a new employee will fit with a company culture. I'm working with my fellow [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/) people! It's [Ideal Solution](http://www.idealso.com/index.php), an IT company that specializes in open source. It's in Lansing, but I'll mostly be telecommuting from home in Redford. This company involves a lot of the guys from [Greater Lansing Linux User Group](www.penguicon.org/wiki/GLLUG/), who have been administrating [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/)'s best computer lounge ever. The objective is to get me into a Project Management role within the company. They'll start me off in Sales where I'll learn the ropes and gradually transition me into managing projects that I sell. From there what I would like to do is gradually increase my training in how to do networking, software development, system administration, hardware and software deployment, and other nuts-and-bolts of the jobs I'll be managing. I want to diversify my skill set as much as possible and see which branches of IT I like best. But the focus will be on managing. It's got much higher earning potential than my last job, and will earn as much even in the worst-case scenario. I can mostly telecommute from home in Redford! The hours will be of normal length and not swamp my volunteering for organizations. Can you tell I'm excited? When it comes to job hunting, cold-calling drools, networking _rules_! Thanks for the tip, ! "All in a day's work, citizens," she says with a flourish of her cape, as she leaps into the sky. "My super-hearing detects connections to be made elsewhere, for truth, justice, and radical improvements in the lives of my friends! Up, up and away!"

Congratulations, go you and go Treebones! I'm thrilled to see this worked out so well for you... and it gives me hope that I and the others I know who really ought to get paid for some of the awesome things they do might stand a chance even in this bottomed-out economy!

I am so ecstatically happy for you, words can't express it. :-D I suppose smiley faces don't really do the trick either. We must celebrate!

Huzzah. Yeah, it's a slighly lamentable fact that even in IT, it's not what you know, but who you know. Glad to hear you know good people . . .

I'm so happy for you. Rock on! It always feels good to get where you're goin' Especially when it's where you want to be. I'd say good luck, but I don't think you'll need it.
