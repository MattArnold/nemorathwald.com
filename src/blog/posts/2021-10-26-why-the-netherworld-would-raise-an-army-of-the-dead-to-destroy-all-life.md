Following up on my experiences with my roommate's dog. Not the older dog, but the yTRANSMISSION BEGINS Can you hear me? Can they hear me? Is this on? My name is Lauren Sheridan. I am from Estacada, Oregon. I promise you I don't have horns or a tail.

I don't know if anyone will receive this. If you do, you might not listen, and I understand your reasons. But I need you to understand that when your loved ones rise from the dead and you are the first ones they try to kill, it is not because they have gone insane. It is because they still love you.

Our means of sending back their minds is incapable of sending back the speech centers. So some of us have developed the technology I am using to attempt to send this message. For the past several decades, we have been iterating through every possible frequency that exists in the physics of the place, in hopes that one will be able to pierce the veil. If you're hearing this, it worked.

We need to explain to you why the netherworld would raise an army of the dead to destroy all life.

To start with, you think we are killing you, but we're not. You are immortal. We are just stabbing and dismembering you. We are very sorry for this. Once you're here, most of you will understand. It has just become urgent to get you out of there.

Furthermore you must understand that we have no reason to bring you here in and of itself. You are going to come here anyway. Everyone. Some of us have spent a career for the last few thousand years recording and looking for exceptions. No one is missing.

That means there is no heaven. It also means this is not hell. There is no Satan here. No one but humans. The question of God's existence is just as much an open question as it TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED Anyway, so I'm never shopping at that pet store again. Pets might seem like a silly thing to blog about, but it helps to just get it off my chest.

I feel I should come up with a good response here. Still not produced one. :-)
