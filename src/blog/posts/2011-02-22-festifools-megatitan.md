![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/Sdk3XuVR8SI/AAAAAAAAGZ8/jOIQj7BmaaE/s400/Festifools%201.JPG) I have been talking a lot about building a giant street puppet for [Festifools](http://festifools.org/) this year. The idea of the Megatitan character from [Revenge of the Titans](http://puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/) has generated a lot of enthusiasm: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_ENXtTKU9j1A/TWQDA5RFh3I/AAAAAAAAIXw/YNC9gMM06d0/s800/revenge-of-the-titans.jpg) It would be 12 feet tall by 8 feet wide. The giant dome of the head would hang from three bamboo poles operated by three puppeteers. A fourth puppeteer would wear the body and walk under the head. I already have three volunteers, although more are welcome. in order for the project to succeed on time, here are the essentials we need to obtain no later than Wednesday, March 9:

1.  Several refrigerator/washing machine boxes, or equivalent amount of corrugated cardboard, at least 2x3 feet wide.
2.  A staple gun.
3.  At least three keychain rings.
4.  At least six zip ties.
5.  Three or four bamboo rods, six to eight feet long.
6.  Dark green, bright green, and white spray paint.
7.  A wide (2" or 3") roll of masking/painters tape.
8.  A truck to transport it from Ferndale to Ann Arbor by 4 PM, Sunday, April 3, and back at 7 PM.

Does anyone have any of these to donate? Non-essential cool additions, if we can get them:

1.  Green transparent tape for the eyes.
2.  Two very bright light sources behind the tape.
3.  Some type of portable battery that can last half an hour, for the lights.
4.  A boom box to project a roaring sound.

I have a staple gun you can borrow, but I'm not "donating" it, I want it back. I have two keychain rings plus a half dozen carabiners and such (depending on what you're doing with the rings, the carabiners might work just as well, or might be completely useless.) I'm pretty sure there's a half-can of white spray paint in the basement. I have some half-rolls of painter's tape, but I'm not sure how old they are, so they may have lost some stickiness. The last round of power outages left us with some small led flashlights, would two of them do for the eye light source? Again, I'd want them back eventually. A failed experiment in lighting the stairway at night has left me with most of a roll of theater glow tape, which you can have if it would be useful (for this or any other project).
