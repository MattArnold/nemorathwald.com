R lent me her car for the day, and there was a Death Cab For Cutie CD in there. I was introduced to "I'll Follow You Into The Dark". I didn't know they did songs about death from a basically nonreligious perspective. I've been thinking about this song ever since. Love of mine Some day you will die But I'll be close behind I'll follow you into the dark No blinding light Or tunnels to gates of white Just our hands clasped so tight Waiting for the hint of a spark If heaven and hell decide That they both are satisfied Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you When your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark In Catholic school As vicious as Roman rule I got my knuckles brusied By a lady in black And I held my toungue as she told me "Son Fear is the heart of love" So I never went back If heaven and hell decide That they both are satisfied Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you When your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark You and me have seen Everything to see From Bangkok to Calgary And the soles of your shoes are all worn down The time for sleep is now It's nothing to cry about Cause we'll hold each other soon The blackest of rooms If heaven and hell decide That they both are satisfied Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs If there's no one beside you When your soul embarks Then I'll follow you into the dark Then I'll follow you into the dark

This song is one of Scott and my songs (like relationship cutesy stuff, hee). When he first showed me the lyrics, I was like... what a depressing song! This isn't sweet at all! But then I listened to it and... it was sweet. So it's been one that reminds me of him ever since.

this song has a profound effect on me as well. I really like the video for it, which was my first introduction to both this song and the band... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNIS0cuDOMw

I love that whole album actually. It somehow manages to be deeply personal to almost everyone who listens to it. It also addresses issues like death, loss, and aging in a way that feels gentle and warm, not fearful. I'm glad you enjoy it too! One of my all time favorite groups.

I'm a huge fan of that song and the band as well. The Postal Service is great too, it's a band with some of the same people.
