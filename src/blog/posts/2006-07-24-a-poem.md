I set off with no land in aim I did not need to find a shore I staked out no presumptious claim I knew the facts, I knew the score I warned myself I didn't have the right A realist I styled myself My self-indulgent dreams were stacked In harmless jars upon the shelf I was a pessimist in fact They have slim chance to come true but they might My optimistic side compelled Such boundless luck was not unfair Experiential facts upheld The golden continent was there My sails took wing and lofted as a kite I kissed the sand upon the beach I lost no opportunity I knew no limits to my reach Sun moon and stars I took with glee As high as they could go, I set my sight I sail again; this land was closed to me I've no regrets, it's worth the while by far For now I know what paradise can be And knowing this, I navigate by star - Matt Arnold, July 23, 2006

Tis a brave person who chooses to look forward, rather than behind, seeking what can be, rather then wishing for what one has lost.

You did not rhyme. You get a B plus for poetry. But an extra ten points for what you said in it.

There are forms of poetry that don't depend rhyme, like the Japanese haiku.

Reminds me of that song by Leonard Cohen called..."Anthem" Ring your bell that still will ring.
