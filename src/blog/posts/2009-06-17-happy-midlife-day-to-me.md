Who wants to hang out for my birthday? I would like to have people over to my apartment tonight, so call me. If you can't make it to Ypsilanti, if someone else wants to host I could go there, depending. I made hummus.

I mean 35. I am widely considered well-preserved.

Happy Birthday. My gift to you was NOT gracing you with my presence and thereby sparing you the nasty cold I've had since wednesday :) Hope you had a good day.

I have become quite good at making hummus. I added hot pepper to this last batch. The level of hot pepper is important. "Just enough so it says hello and flirts in a spicy way, but doesn't ask for your number or hang out in a tree with binoculars."
