The Penguicon 2010 Souvenir Book is seeking Zonker Facts. Like Chuck Norris Facts, but about Penguicon's Guest of Honor Joe "Zonker" Brockmeier. Keep it Safe For Work, please. Also seeking contributions to a lengthy Disclaimer about Zonker Facts. For inspiration, see the following bios of Zonker, and one of our Nifty Guests, Patrick Rothfuss: Joe ‘Zonker’ Brockmeier is a freelance writer and editor with more than 10 years covering IT. Formerly the openSUSE Community Manager for Novell, Brockmeier has written for Linux Magazine, Sys Admin, Linux Pro Magazine, IBM developerWorks, Linux.com, CIO.com, Linux Weekly News, ZDNet, and many other publications. Brockmeier is also active in the FLOSS community and works with the GNOME Project on PR and marketing. You can reach Zonker at jzb@zonker.net and follow him on Twitter. Patrick Rothfuss sprung fully formed from Marge Rothfuss, his mother, in Madison Wisconsin. In a mere three months, Pat grew to the height of a man while teaching himself to read and write using only a shovel and a dead cat. When the voices told him to, Pat left home to attend college in at University Wisconsin Stevens Point where he joined Slytherin house and had many wonderful adventures. After graduating, Pat evolved into a being of pure light and energy. Then he went to grad school and evolved even further into being composed entirely of bile, anger, binder twine, and sweet, sweet, methadone. After grad school Pat joined forces with five plucky Japanese schoolgirls to form a giant robot that fights crime. Through all of this Pat has read fantasy, watched fantasy, and written fantasy. Some academics have suggested that Pat eats, sleeps, and breathes fantasy, but this is simply untrue. The truth is that Pat eats burritos, sleeps like a drooly baby, and breathes a white-hot plasma composed of molten gold and rage.

Wasn't this already done for Bruce Schneier?
