I leave for Colorado tonight. As you know if you read her blog, 's grandmother is not long for this world, so this is their last chance to see each other. I don't want driving an eighteen hour road trip on her own. Besides, I like road trips with her. There will be internet access from the hotel. I still plan to drop in at MPCon some time on Saturday.

Yay road trips! I'm going to Colorado on the 3rd, but by plane. I just don't have the time to fly. Plus it's cheaper than driving.

I have to leave for a bit on Saturday, but hopefully I'll see you there!
