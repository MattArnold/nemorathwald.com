According to the BBC, [scientists have invented a treatment for cancer](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4734507.stm) using fullerenes coated with a vitamin that only cancer cells have receptors for. The fullerines are heated with a laser to kill off only the cancer cells, leaving healthy cells intact. R's mother is undergoing radiation therapy for a tumor which was recently removed, and it's heartening to know that someday soon radiation and chemo will not be necessary.
