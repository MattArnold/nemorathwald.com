Where is everybody? There are supposed to be a thousand attendees at Philcon but this hotel is much too spacious for that number. The con doesn't have the function space to ourselves, even though the room block is sold out. Against their agreement with the convention, the hotel kicked us out of the Logfest room to set up for someone else tomorrow. So we set up a fan table on the table where information used to be before they closed it, and watched the incredibly sparse passersby. Bill and I just got done hot tubbing and swimming for a few minutes, but there was nobody else there. It's closed now. There are no room parties. As I type this, I'm watching an anime (not on the schedule) with only two other people. At least the Consuite is good, with good snacks and 2-liters of pop, comfy chairs, and interesting conversations. It's roughly the size of a room party suite, but not very crowded. It closes at three in the morning, which is reasonable. At quarter after midnight, the con is not only dead, it's officially scheduled as dead. I'm going to bed.
