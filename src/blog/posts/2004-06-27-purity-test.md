I don't know why the results are set up in such a confusing way. Each the percentages are inverted from how we expect them to display. For instance, when the subject of the test does not click any of the check-boxes on a category, one would expect that to result in a 0% rating, not 100%. So, this test is saying I am about one-third at ease around myself, not shameless at all, relatively low sex drive (or fulfillment), four-fifths straight-experienced, not gay-experienced at all and not "sick" (to use their word) at all.
