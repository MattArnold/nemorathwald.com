I rented the anime anthology [_Memories_](http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue363/anime.html) by the creator of _Akira,_ Otomo Katsuhiro. The entire film is top-notch, with breathtaking visuals and uncompromising artistry. Each segment is an individual vision instead of marketing-driven by a board table full of business suits. The first episode, _Magnetic Rose,_ set in orbit in 2192, is now my favorite work of animation ever. It's rare to see zero-gravity depicted and ships with thrusters that actually fire correctly to move in it, even in anime (_Cowboy Bebop_ notwithstanding). For its realistic acting and plausible visualization of the future I've got to own _Magnetic Rose_. A couple of technologies (which I won't describe to avoid spoiling it) are on the blue-sky fringe of legitimate futurics, but are depicted so convincingly that they are more an asset than a liability to the segment. The film contrasts them against a background of solidly realistic hi-tech which is antique to the characters because it's based on our own present-day research trends. I'd like to show _Magnetic Rose_ to my [GURPS Transhuman Space](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/transhuman/) group, but I doubt I'll find a copy in time for our session Saturday.

I also liked Magnetic Rose because of the haunting story, gorgeous visuals, and great music (Puccinni's Madame Butterfly and an original choral piece with saxaphone). :-) I think everyone should see this. It is simply bind-bogglingly good.
