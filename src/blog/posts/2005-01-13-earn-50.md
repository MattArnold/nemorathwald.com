If you intend to get satellite radio in the next 12 months, contact me. You can get $50 bucks from the place I work for by being in a two hour focus group on Monday.

What time is the focus group? I have a meeting on Monday at 11am, so I don't think I'd be there (depending on where it is) before 2 or 3. But I am thinking about it. I think it'd make a nice Christmas present to myself. :)

It's in Oakland County. One of them is 4 to 6 pm and the other is 6 to 8 pm. Contact me by e-mail if you want me to put you in touch with them.

It's all full up now. Sorry.
