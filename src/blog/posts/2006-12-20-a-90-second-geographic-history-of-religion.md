That's pretty damn sweet! I had a few things out of order in my hed, so it's nice to have it clarified. It's interesting how Judaism just completely disappears from the map until modern times. It was there, but I guess they were just so outnumbered and spread out, there's no good way to show it. I'm hoping that's why it's like that, anyway.

They're color-coding based on majority of the population, and once Christianity came around the Jews weren't a majority anywhere until the founding of the state of Israel.

Yeah, that's true. Although the map has the Jews disappearing before that..........

To have this available for history and/or religion students would be very handy.

It's interesting and very well done. I'm not certain I agree with the United States being painted a Christian nation. Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb and their son Tom would probably question that.
