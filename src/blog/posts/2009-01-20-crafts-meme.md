The first five people to respond to this post will get something made by me! My choice. For you. This offer does have some restrictions and limitations: - I make no guarantees that you will like what I make! - What I create will be just for you. - It'll be done this year. - You have no clue what it's going to be. It may be a story. It may be poetry. I may draw or paint something. I may bake you something and mail it to you. Who knows? Not you, that's for sure! - I reserve the right to do something extremely strange. The catch? Oh, the catch is that you have to repost. We can all make stuff!!

Awesome. I like the idea of a meme where you really have to do something, rather than just posting something on your blog. Oh wait, I just responded to this, didn't I?

What color hat do you want? With or without eyeball; they're available from Oriental Trading.
