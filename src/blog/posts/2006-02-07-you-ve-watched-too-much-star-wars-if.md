joined us Saturday evening for a few hours of the weekend-long Star Wars marathon, but had to go back home. Her attendance was limited because of the weather. The weather also caused power outages, but 's parents house has an emergency generator that instantly kicks in. Sunday morning I got up early again and cooked waffles, bacon and eggs for everybody. Since all the music they had in the house was techno or polka, I had made sure to grab an [Eri Sugai CD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007X9U6K/sr=1-2/qid=1139323608/) from 's car. Nice soft morning music that people can sleep through. I missed the end of the marathon while helping paint her living room. I definitely had had enough Star Wars for one weekend. While I was gone, reportedly those who remained had a sort of "Dead Dog Party" because it had been like a mini-convention, and came up with some "ways to know when you've been watching too much Star Wars." When you describe as having the Light Side of the Flirtation and as having the Dark Side. When the movie soundtrack keeps replaying over and over in your head. When you hear someone say "May the Force be with you," and you answer "And also with you," and your Christian friend then says "Amen"-- that happened approximately 75 times this weekend. One of the nice things about spending the weekend out there was being present for the ultimate perfection of the [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/) distro of [OpenCola](http://wiki.penguicon.org/OpenCola). came up with a technique for transferring precisely distributed flavor oils, involving sugar in a coffee grinder, which was so "[Rube Goldberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg)" it out-geeked even me. He felt an intense sort of victory about that. He also synthesized the results of the umpteen uncountable taste-test answer forms we accumulated at ConFusion. I tasted the resulting batch. There was a long silence. Then I intoned, "I have dreamed a dream. And now that dream has come to me." I can't wait for you to taste it at Penguicon.

You drop so many LJ IDs, and I'm sure that I've met some of these people before, and have read their blogs, but I'll be damned if don't know who they are. So my question is, is anyone doing LiveJournal ribbons this year at Penguicon?

That's a very good question! Someone did in the past. We'd better do it this year! I'll check with Penguicon's Ribbon Wrangler, , and tell her that if nobody orders LJ ribbons by the end of the month (the deadline is March 5), to let me know so I can make sure somebody does.

That would be great. Perhaps LJers could pool our money together.

I'll pledge $5 if you'll pledge at least that much. Who's with us?

I don't know (though I know who he is), and am curious about what "dark side of flirting" means...

Err, now that I clicked on his LJ information, maybe I don't know who he is after all. I also wanted to say that I would chip in $5 for ribbons too.

Heh heh heh... Let me show you, my child. They always come in pairs, . Sometimes they're not who you think. ;) (Seriously though, I get a happy smile when I think of me as the Light Side of the Force of Flirting.)

Cuter than Luke Skywalker, too! Incidentally, you are awesome, because whenever you comment on something I've said it makes me laugh. :)
