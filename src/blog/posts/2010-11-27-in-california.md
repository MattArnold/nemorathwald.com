We were supposed to arrive Sunday, but arrived this morning in the greater San Francisco environs. We pushed straight through, stopping only for fuel and restrooms, subsisting on a Thanksgiving repast of Pop Tarts, beef jerky, trail mix, cookies, crackers, soda, cranberry juice, and water. Just in case we encountered car trouble, a blizzard, or a zombie outbreak, we put my plane ticket on Wednesday evening. I now do not know what to do with myself for five days. Here I am in California! Hi!

Go to the ocean! Look at some fish. Take photos. Get a sunburn. Smell the fog! Meet some people. Drink some coffee. And maybe pan for gold! Whatever you do, don't attempt to walk up or down Lombard Street, if I remember correctly you need to plan far more time to get to the top than you think it will take you. But the view from Coit (sp?) is breathtaking. Okay, have fun. Oh and visit the Castro for me!

Unfortunately, until I get my first paycheck, I possess no money in any form. I'll bring it up with my hosts and see if they want to go to those places, as I'm actually in Pleasanton, an hour away from the coast.

Holy crap, my aunt lives in Pleasanton! We went to visit in 1987 or so, and we went to the actual city by them dropping us off at a park-and-ride on their way to work, and then we took the subway from there. Still not free, of course...
