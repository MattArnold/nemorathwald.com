I turned 1,000,000,000 seconds old at 4 AM this morning. was originally planning to call me at 4 AM and wish me a happy birthsecond during the actual second, but in light of changed circumstances we decided it was not a good idea for the phone to ring in the house at that hour. Last night I was his only co-host on The Toad Elevating Moment comedy music internet radio show, and he decided it would be the Matt Episode this time. So we played all the neat music that I have found available for free on the internet and brought to the show over the years. \- [Dr. Who On Holiday](http://www.nemorathwald.com/American%20Edit/02%20-%20Dean%20Gray%20-%20Dr%20Who%20on%20Holiday.mp3), a Green Day/Dr. Who remix. - Covers of two of my favorite They Might Be Giants' songs: "Birdhouse In Your Soul" ([mp3 link](http://www.archivestowearpantsto.com/tracks/0214_birdhouse_in_your_soul.mp3)) and "Experimental Film" ([mp3 link](http://www.archivestowearpantsto.com/tracks/0264_experimental_film.mp3)), covered by [Songs To Wear Pants To](http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/). "Experimental Film" represents the energy, reckless enthusiasm and all-around craziness of [Penguicon](http://www.penguicon.org/) to me. - "The Touchtone Genius" ([mp3 link](http://www.archivestowearpantsto.com/tracks/0219_the_touchtone_genius.mp3)) also by [Songs To Wear Pants To](http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/). - "[I Am The Very Model Of A Singularitarian](http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0626.html)" by Charlie Kam. - "Jerry Falwell's God" ([mp3 link](http://www.royzimmerman.com/mp3/Homeland32/08.%20Jerry%20Falwell's%20God.mp3)) and "Chickenhawk" ([mp3 link](http://www.royzimmerman.com/mp3/chickenhawk.mp3)) by a new political/religious satirist [Roy Zimmerman](http://www.royzimmerman.com), who I found out about through [the blog of PZ Myers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/we_have_ways_of_making_you_tal.php). Last week's episode was the Bitching Episode where I was not allowed to attend, because the single guys were going to bitch about being single. I'm a week too late for that, but I certainly have **nothing** to bitch about. I'm in high spirits and no shortage of love from the community. You are all terrific. :) During sets of music we finished the banner for my party, which starts at 7 tonight. All is in readiness. Some guests volunteered to take trunkfuls of my stuff with them afterward and drop them off at my new home with Chuck because they'll be going that way. (Yes, it's set. I paid, got a key, everything. I'm quite excited.) If you'd like, bring boxes that are not too large to be too heavy when filled with books! I love showing off my books, posters, framed prints, computers, gadgets and gizmos, and [my sculpture in progress](http://pics.livejournal.com/matt_arnold/gallery/0000eh5w). So I have not packed them.

I wish I could show up tonight, I have some boxes as well as some plastic tubs I could give you on loan for the move. As for your emotional state, I'm glad you're doing well. We love you, and worry about you :)

I'd like to wish a very happy billionth second, and hope you have many more arbritrary happy seconds in your life. (How did I miss my own billionth second, geez?) The pictures of your sculpture are very interesting. It looks considerably different now that it's been cast. I'm curious, did you destroy the original in the process of creating the mold? Very cool.

Of course, it helps if I spell arbitrary correctly, and login.

The photos show the mold. I haven't cast it yet. What you see in the photo is a fiberglass shell over ten layers of rubber over the original clay. I have to scoop the clay out, so yes, the original is destroyed.

Happy be-lated birthsecond. Sorry, I decided not to come, since I'm still fighting this whatever I have. Anyway, hope the party was stellar and you had fun! And congrats on the new place - you and Chuck will have fun I'm sure.
