[As reported by BoingBoing.net,](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/24/strosss_singularity_.html) Science fiction author Charlie Stross has started a Wiki called [Singularity! A tough guide to the rapture of the nerds.](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/toughguide.html) The stated intent is to learn about the Singularity, but this would only be true in roughly the same sense that [QuackWatch](http://www.quackwatch.org/) is a site to "learn about" alternative medicine. What Stross has written in his wiki so far is pretty funny, but it's difficult to interpret his intent as anything but debunking and ridicule. I recommmend Eliezer Yudkowski's mind-bending [Shock Level 4 Wiki](http://www.sl4.org/wiki/) to those interested in learning about the Singularity. Charlie Stross has written serious fiction that is fascinating and enjoyable for those interested in the Singularity, such as the delightful "Toast: A Con Report." But from a self-marketing perspective, what effect does he expect to have on his readership by expressing off-handed contempt for them in this site? Consider how his sometimes-collaborator Cory Doctorow gains readership and sells books by [positioning himself as the champion of our media consumer rights, thus shaping the actual future.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/matt_arnold/40860.html) Both of these self-marketing strategies-- Doctorow's brilliant one and Stross' apparent lack of one-- are unrelated to the writing talent of the author, and of course both of these authors would not have succeeded unless they were talented, but it's a fact of life that attracting the necessary attention to succeed in media is about understanding who is making what entertainment choices and the psychology behind it. For instance, I used to read Orson Scott Card voraciously until he turned the center of his public platform into his religious views, instead of his fiction. (Homosexuals and secular humanists did not do that, he did. Those who want to keep their private religious views from affecting their sales are wise, and don't write [newspaper](http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html) [editorials](http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110005312) about it.) These days I shrug and "ho-hum" over his novels even though they are no less brilliant. It's natural for authors to prioritize writing talent over all other concerns, but do they understand that not all their fans are like that? We're not just "the readers," we continue to exist after we put the book down. That means we don't care about quality fiction as much as we care about our own passions, from which our reading choices stem. Charlie Stross could take a lesson from the approach of [Matthew Woodring Stover's interview with The SF Site.](http://www.sfsite.com/04a/mws101.htm) Stover criticizes problems with the fantasy genre as currently seen on store shelves, but unlike Stross he does not have fun at the expense of those who enjoy it, he flatters them with having a craving for better. His criticism is in earnest, he cares enough to repair fantasy rather than discard it, and he describes how he does so. As a result, this interview was the first time I felt a real interest in reading fantasy, and if I do it will be Matthew Woodring Stover. This is the correct approach to pointing out problems (of which there are many) with the Singularity meme for anyone who wants to be an SF author. Point out issues with Eric K. Drexler and Ray Kurzweil in that way and we will flock to you; if the best you can do when we are introduced to you is call us goobers for having taken them seriously, we will not be motivated to read you. As Eliezer Yudkowsky has said about certain Singularity fiction authors [in a conversation with Damien Broderick,](http://www.sl4.org/archive/0505/11235.html) "The Singularity is not an ironic commentary on the rate of change." As that rare creature, a science fiction fan who still actually believes in the future, I know what it's like to thoughtfully ponder outrageous possibilities, with an eye that is critical without being an antagonistic outsider. I want to read an author only when I can tell that she or he knows what that is like.

I'm LMFAO. You've got to read this parody article on Locus Online: http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Features/0401\_Stross.html _Charles Stross Attains Posthuman Status_ "... Aussie critic and potential "Spiker" himself, Damien Broderick, comments, "I tried to visit \[Greg\] Egan years ago, and found myself stuck in a timelike infinity loop once I got too close to his nominal address. Only the concerted efforts of Stephen Baxter, Vernor Vinge and Greg Bear were able to free me."
