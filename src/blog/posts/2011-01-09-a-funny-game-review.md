I found [this in the Monopoly forums](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/593386/monopoly-a-very-short-entirely-necessary-review) on [Boardgamegeek.com](http://boardgamegeek.com):

> Of all the board games out there in the world, there's one that's popular far out of proportion to its actual quality. This game drags on interminably, as players roll the dice over and over, hoping to eventually gain something that they can trade for something worthwhile. The trading and negotiation aspect, which is about all this game has to speak in its favour, is essentially an elaborate scam, created to fool the players into thinking the experience is anything more than an over-long exercise with all the skill and strategy of Yahtzee in 100 times the playing time. No one should be fooled, though, because in the end it's just a terrible, terrible game. But enough about Settlers of Catan; I'm here to review Monopoly.

Zing!

damn, tonight's hardass lyric! Of course, Monopoly is, if anything, venerable, having been made in the 30's. It's kinda like calling the Mona Lisa a doodle, or comparing the Great Wall to a lean-to shanty LOL.

Sure. Monopoly, while flawed, has its strengths. It's only after joining the boardgame community that I found out you are allowed to trade and negotiate in Monopoly; my misunderstanding explains why it was never fun for me.
