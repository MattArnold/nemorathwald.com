Nanodot has [this report](http://new.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=1944): _You may laugh, or at least smile, but the environmental benefits already resulting from the so-called [nanotech toilet](http://www.extremenano.com/article/Nanotech+Toilets+Take+Off/152518_1.aspx) are substantial. With a “roughness” reported at under 30 nanometers, evidently these fixtures need much less cleaning, which means much less of that nasty chemical cleanser going down the drain. Oh, and they should be healthier for users too. Read the whole thing, on ExtremeNano by the prolific Norm Wu._

Why not coat them in Teflon?

yeah, maybe that way I can't clog up the drain so easy.
