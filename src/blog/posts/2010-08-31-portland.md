Do you someone in Portland, Oregon? Do you vouch for them? Would they be willing to let a woman sleep on their couch for a couple of weeks while looking for work there?

I have to ask, why would anyone go to Portland to look for work? The job market is awful there.

Because they're going to get free travel to go to Portland for a conference, and because of hearing legendary stories of how awesome it is to live in Portland.

Two comments from the person in question: 1. She's already heard that there are computer jobs there. 2. Every time she names an American city, without exception, she's told the job market is awful there.

I can put you in touch with someone who lives just north of the area and has many geek/fen contacts, although I don't know if they'd have crash space right now. Drop a line to (or else try triplelle at etsy.com) and mention me. I've known Lisa for over 20 years, so I'll certainly vouch for her. Describe the situation, and whom she can vouch for, you can trust.
