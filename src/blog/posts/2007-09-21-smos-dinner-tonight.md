To those of you who subscribe to the Penguicon LJ, sorry for the double posting-- but the SMOS Dinner is at my place in Hazel Park tonight. Bring chairs please! There will be vegetarian pizza, all-meat pizza, and wings. Plus if you want to bring something to share, we won't say no! Email me at my gmail account, matt dot mattarn, for directions.
