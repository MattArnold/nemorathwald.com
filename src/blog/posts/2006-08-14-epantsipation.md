[Here's a link to another parody of a Jack Chick cartoon tract.](http://www.verysmallarray.com/?p=60#comments) This one has all original storyline and art. It's lighthearted fun. Did you know when God created the world, pants were created for the bondage of the Assyrians\*, not for the saved? Will you accept personal salvation through the removal of pants? I love how they even include obscure references with asterisks, such as "DF Wallace, Harper's". A spot-on parody. \* DF Wallace, Harper's

OK, maybe it's just this awful virus, but I feel clueless today. What is this a parody of?

Here's [a link to actual Jack Chick cartoon tracts.](http://www.chick.com/catalog/tractlist.asp) Note that the distinctive feature of this series has been the last page, which is a consistent salvation sales pitch across almost every tract, very effectively lampooned in the Cthulhu parody ["Who Will Be Eaten First?"](http://bellend.strtok.net/~tyler/cthulhu/) In the social circles you and I travel in, Chick is best known for his tract ["Dark Dungeons",](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp) about the dangers of Dungeons and Dragons teaching real witchcraft and causing suicide, [parodied here.](http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/03/image-dogtoring-1-christians-crusades.html)

My favorite parody is [Antlers of the Damned](http://www.weirdcrap.com/chick/antlers/antlers.html). Space Moose was so over the top, and so very missed...

Oops. Seems the link was from a comment, not the main post. Should check that one out, though.

"Will you accept personal salvation through the removal of pants?" That SO sounds like a good pick-up line to use on a Fundie ROFL.

There's a list of parodies available at http://www.weirdcrap.com/ Some of them are worthy of printing out and slipping into a stack of real Chick tracts. Hilarity then ensues. I'm particularly fond of God Meat, Judgement Day, and Scream For Your God.

Pretty cool. Except Marilyn Monroe did wear pants, sometimes. There's a publicity shot from one of her movies, but I don't remember which one--the one that co-starred Jimmy Dean, maybe? :-)
