This survey is for those who keep weblogs. At no point during or after taking it did was I informed of who Cameron was or why he needed to be freed, so _caveat emptor._ I need a T-Shirt reading "I went to a survey about blogs and all I got was this lousy choice of banners to post to my site." In the interest of full disclosure and truth in advertising (such as it is) I took all of them.
