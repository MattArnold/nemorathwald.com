Penguicon 4.0 was one of the most fun conventions I've ever been to. That's saying _a lot_.

Hey \*swan\* here. It was more or less Bjork's swan dress from the 2001 Oscars. It was my first con and thought it was going to be a good idea. I was positively freezing for 2 hours. I had no idea the masqarade would be that loooooong.

Hi Matt, Thanks for posting the photos! I had a great time and have every intention of returning next year. And yes, that workshop info, need to write up and send you. Probably later this week . .. What is your email address? (mine is adale@merlynproductions.com). Andrea

Andrea, it was delightful to meet you. Thank you for your participation and your great talent. "Zen Cappucinno" was the soundtrack in my head most of the weekend! My email is matt.mattarn@gmail.com. Send me the writeup any time, and remember, any more ideas that you have are very welcome.

BTW, it's not "Wood and foam rubber", it's "PVC pipe, fiberglass tape and foam rubber". That and "boffer swords" are SCA equipment (Aegis!= SCA). It's more appropriate to call Aegis equipment "practice swords".

I knew Aegis used swords that were highly elaborate, but I didn't realize they were different enough to merit their own terminology. I've edited the caption to reflect this.

Sal has a couple SCA "boffer" swords in the rack at the Haven facility. The difference is night and day. I'll show you my <shiny>full basket hilted</shiny> practice sword sometime. (p.s. there's a second caption that references "wood and foam rubber")

Actually, some of the advanced students \*do\* use a wood core, but that's with permission only because it's much easier to break bones that way. The main difference between "boffers" and Aegis swords is the existence of a flat, unpadded part. It takes more control to use these properly as opposed to the completely round and padded boffer swords that won't hurt if you turn them the wrong way. Thanks for putting the pictures up; they are all great. :)

Well, maybe it's just me, then. I was thinking that the con, while still very enjoyable, has been coasting downhill since 2.0. Of course, I may be giving 3.0 a bad rap, because I did have a physical ailment during con last year that kept me from enjoying it to its fullest. This year was a lot of fun, and a much needed break from the drudgery of "real life", but all weekend long I was feeling like something was lacking. I didn't see the crazy t-shirts I've grown to expect. I didn't attend masquerade, but that never stopped me from seeing lots and lots of costuems before. This year I saw very few costumes.
