I've answered 700 "Improve My Matches" questions on [OKcupid](http://www.okcupid.com/) and the Uberalgorithm thinks it has my personality pegged. True? Or not? "Compared to males his age: He is **less adventurous** than most. He is **less spontaneous** than most. He is **more literary** than most. He is **less loving** than most. He is **more capitalistic** than most. He is **more pure** than most. He is **more independent** than most."

Other than that "more pure" thing, I think it's got you pegged.

I think it depends on how pure most people are, and also on whether it's judging the purity of the experiences or purity of the mind!
