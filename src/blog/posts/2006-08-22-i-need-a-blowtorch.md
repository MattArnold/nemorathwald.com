If you want to get a BernzoMatic TS4000, I'll put $20 toward it and I'll buy the fuel bottle. You can find the head here: http://tinyurl.com/zxjex This is by far the lowest price I've seen. It's an ebay auction that ends in three hours. The TS4000 is the one to get, not the TS3000. If you're interested, pick one up and I'll reimburse you for $20 plus the price of the fuel bottle (bought locally).

I have a torch head that you can put on a standard fuel bottle if you want a propane torch... actually, I might even have a fuel bottle kicking around. How soon do you need it?

Awesome. Thank you! I need to use it on the plastic casings of some broken-off screws in the brick exterior of the house. I told I'd finish the job this week.

I have a partially full bottle of propane as well. I'll see him tomorrow evening (I think) and can get it to him to give to you if that is early enough...
