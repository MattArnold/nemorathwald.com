I programmed [this dice game](http://arnoldworks.com/falconers/) to teach myself the JQuery library for Javascript, and to improve my Javascript skills. There will be many more features. If you think the current version is neat, you're really going to like it. I'm excited. And oh, yes, the visual design will also improve. But you know what they say: launch with the mimimum viable product. Shout-outs go to my friends on the [Lojban](http://lojban.org/) #jbopre IRC channel for their patience in answering my questions: rlpowell, chrisdone, kpreid, and Tene. Thanks to for his professional tutelage and for hosting the webspace.

Wow. I tried the game, and I think the game play is fun and I'm mightily impressed you programmed it. I'm excited to see some art over it, though, as I'm not sure what it has to do with falconry. Also, it was hard to figure out that I should click on those actions and points. They don't look like typical widgets that a user would interact with. You might want something that looks a little more like a button, or uses an icon on the button and put the text in a mouseover.

Thanks! I'll try that suggestion on the development version and see how it looks.
