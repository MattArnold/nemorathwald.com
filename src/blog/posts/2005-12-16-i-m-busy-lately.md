Dear friends, I owe you a conclusion to the Philcon report, photos of Logfest, and a speech about Dean Gray Tuesday. The past few weeks I've worked late almost every night, because of the pre-Christmas workload that takes place at any ad agency. It was not the right time of year to take a vacation and have a backlog of work when I get back from it. Today I was asked to lock dozens of documents in the database, create dozens more by end of day Monday, and simultaneously substitute for the receptionist. All this in addition to putting out fires that started on my jobs while I was gone. The stress is intense. This is why I was late altering [my homepage](http://www.nemorathwald.com/) for Dean Gray Tuesday, and why I still haven't taken it down. What little time I have at home, I'm _too tired to blog._ I just curl up with [The John Varley Reader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441011950/), relax, and enjoy it immensely until I fall asleep. Thanks to and for loaning it to me. ("Callahan's Place" by Spider Robinson doesn't fit me so well. It reminds me of a heartwarming TV special about the milk of human kindness, complete with a world full of Scrooges who don't keep Callahan's in their hearts all year round. Thanks for the loan of it anyway, and please don't be shy about further recommendations.) Last night came to my office wearing formal wear at 6PM, bearing my suit and tie, to go to my employer's holiday party, but I didn't get my ads shipped until 8PM. We did not relish driving downtown in this weather for only a half-hour of fun. Being all dressed up with no place to go, we went to the Japanese restaurant next door, which was wonderful. Here's my Callahan's toast: "To Christmas madness being over for one more year!"

Somehow I sorta figured that those pieces of Spider Robinson's collection would not appeal a lot to you. . . . But you never know. I would suggest his "StarDancer" series and his DeathKiller/LifeHouse series. . . .The latter of which includes a very amusing look at Fandom. He does, in all of his work, tend to concentrate on closed enclaves of "empathic/loving" people, seperated form the rest of humanity, which is usualy represented as rather cold and self-isolating .. . . But that's a perspective I generally like. . . . Especialy considering the group of friends I hang out with \*grin\*

i hope you can feel my intense envy. John Varley has been my idol since i was ten years old. I still haven't gotten my hands on "the ophiuchi hotline". If you know where i can get it, i am willing to slaughter a busload of Franciscans to get it.
