I'm blogging this from the Digital Citizenship Symposium at Wayne State University. I'll be here all day. The library gives out login accounts to their guest terminals, and that's what I'm using. Vernor Vinge and I hope to have time to get some lunch or coffee and discuss the unique opportunities for topics at Penguicon that combine science fiction and computing to a degree that even he has probably not been given by the other SF conventions to which he is so often invited. Hearing Vernor Vinge speak at a Symposium such as this is an attendance draw; hearing him speak at an SF convention is an attendance draw; but hearing him speak at Penguicon would be on a whole new level. The Symposium is starting, so off I go.

Hey, I link to Vinge news from my squidoo lens at http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/workshop/VernorVinge and found this page with a Google alert. If you were to blog about Vinge's role at the symposium, I'd love to read and link to it. Chris
