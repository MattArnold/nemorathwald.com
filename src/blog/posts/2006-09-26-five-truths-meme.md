Ganked from . List five truths. Five things that are on your mind. Good, bad, it matters not. Lift some weight off. Then, pick five people to do the same. 1. Having one's fortune told is no better of a reason for rearranging one's relationships than it was to tell Reagan how to run the country and where to send the military. 2. There is a blurry line between scary and funny, and [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs) knows exactly where that line is. 3. Server administration skills are rarer, more important, and more deserving of latitude than skills I possess, such as spelling. 4. SMOS stands for [Secret Masters](http://www.stilyagi.org/fanspeak.html#SMOF) of [SMOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym). 5. [The rules of a board game should be taught with a wide-angle lens first, then zooming in to the rule exceptions.](http://thegamesjournal.com/articles/TeachingRules.shtml)

On #5: I think this is true, but it applies more generally. It certainly is a basic rule of thumb I try to use when teaching math or dancing.

I \*love\* #4.

He found the line perfectly (I mean, now I REALLY want a copy of "Creepy Doll" -- I alternated between shuddering and busting a gut listening to it), but the question is: does he _know_ that he found the line?

He makes some of his songs available as individual source tracks with the singing separate from the instrumentation. For this reason, I'd like to translate some of them into Lojban. I would especially enjoy performing "When You Go," because I have a predilection for a capella. I understand you've been busy lately, and out of touch. When might you be available again?

#2 is right on. Does PZ Meyers know about this guy? Because he does have a song about a giant squid.

Yes, I told him about it! He liked it.
