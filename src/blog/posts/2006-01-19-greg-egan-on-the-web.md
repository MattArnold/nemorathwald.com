Several months ago I signed up to receive [Google Alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts) of any new mentions on the web of [Greg Egan](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/), who as you know is [my favorite author of all time](http://www.nemorathwald.com/SFandF.htm). Unfortunately, there are at least two other Greg Egans who get more press than the Australian science fiction master, so I've had to modify the parameters of the persistent search to exclude the words "hockey" and "wrestler". Also, it kind of upsets me that [www.gregegan.com](http://www.gregegan.com) leads to a placeholder page for a defunct website that has nothing to do with him, while Mr. Egan himself uses [gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/). If I wrote to Mr. Egan and offered to buy that domain for him and pay for it to be maintained, I wonder if the reclusive and invisible author would even respond? While on a panel at [ConFusion 2004](http://www.stilyagi.org/cons/2006/), [Karl Schroeder](http://www.karlschroeder.com/) once said that Greg Egan doesn't go to conventions, hardly anybody even knows what he looks like, and it is humorously rumored that he may actually be an artificial intelligence. Later, this hypothesis was repeated near the end of [a hilarious article by Paul di Filippo in Locus Online](http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Features/0401_Stross.html). Well you know what? The way my luck has been going lately I bet he would respond to me! I'll try it!

I think you should try it! Let us know if anything comes of it!

Unfortunately, the owner of that domain responded to me today with a very polite e-mail stating that he wasn't going to sell it. So now I need some other excuse to approach Greg Egan. I had a similar problem a couple of hours ago. The ConFusion guest of honor, Vernor Vinge, was sitting right there. But I suddenly found that I could think of nothing to say... I can't believe it. It's probably just that I felt exhausted this evening. I'll make up for lost time this weekend. :) What fun it was this evening to sit around the room hear no less a Singularity expert than Vernor Vinge talk to Eric Raymond about Ray Kurzweil's book "The Singularity Is Near" which I blogged about yesterday! remarked on her extreme amusement at how I became so over-psyched-up as the party went on, my eyes started glazing over. There is apparently only so much admiration and enthusiasm I can feel before I hit some kind of overdose. Hmmm. I don't think I've ever passed that threshold before. I am going to have a ton to blog about this weekend. But I just finished the room party posters and it's late, and I'm going to bed to let my brain marinate. :)
