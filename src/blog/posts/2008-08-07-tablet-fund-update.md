![](http://z.about.com/d/graphicssoft/1/G/w/x/4/Aiptek-Slim-Tablet.jpg)The [fund to purchase a decent graphics tablet](http://matt-arnold.livejournal.com/242238.html) is proceeding well! It has been fascinating to see this experiment unfold. I think people are motivated by the desire to not come up with an idea of something to draw. That may have reduced the number of smaller donations, but this has not been an impediment to success. That doesn't change the fact that you can still get a sketch for a song. Given that your support of $5 or more gets you a gift of _two_ sketches, the correct inference is that a tip between $0.01 and $4.99 gets you _one_. Yes it will. However, PayPal deducts thirty cents plus three percent, so, please deliver less than a dollar in person. Speaking of non-PayPal: you can absolutely use whatever means to donate. Pledges are fine, as long as you fulfill the pledge to me at the home of and tomorrow evening, or the Penguicon concom meeting at the Crowne Plaza in Romulus this Saturday afternoon, at which time the fund drive will close. If all you can afford is one penny and a sketch idea, that is still support, which will be gratefully received. I'll give a final report afterward, but this will be the last mention I make until then.
