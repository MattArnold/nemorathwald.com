[Laser cutting at i3Detroit, Feb 12, 2011](http://vimeo.com/19881430) from [Matt Arnold](http://vimeo.com/user1196373) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

This laser plotter has finished engraving the pieces I designed, and is now cutting the perimeters of the pieces. This is 1/4" medium density fiberboard. This is at i3Detroit hacker space, in Ferndale, MI.
