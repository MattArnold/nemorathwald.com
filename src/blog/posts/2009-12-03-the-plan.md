Hey folks, just to let you know, I have the use of my phone now, and will shortly have insurance with which to drive my car again. So, I will be re-engaged in the life of the community! I have taken out student loans for next semester at Henry Ford Community College to complete my Web Developer certificate with full-time classes. There is a chance that I can do it in one semester, depending on what I test out of.
