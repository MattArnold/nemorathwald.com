Tonight I'm going to my parents house for a celebratory dinner; tomorrow night Blasted Bill is throwing a party for the birthdays of me, Minion and Narf from [_The Toad Elevating Moment_](http://dementiaradio.org/) internet radio show; and Saturday night my friends at [Aegis Consulting](http://www.aegisconsulting.org/basic_swordsmanship.html) are throwing an Equinox party on the shortest night of the year to celebrate several birthdays. There were three gifts I asked for. If you have read [the games section of my home website](http://www.geocities.com/nemorathwald/Games.htm#naviadrapt) you might know I have been waiting a year for Bandai to release their collectable chess variant [_Navia Dratp_](http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/naviadratp.html), but according to the [Japanese import store](http://masquerade-games4anime.bigstep.com/) located down the street from me, Bandai keeps [delaying the debut](http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/3941.html), which was supposed to have been in October, then January. They don't know when the shipment will come in. [_Schild's Ladder_](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/SCHILD/SCHILD.html) is the only Greg Egan I haven't read; an [_Omega Chess_ set](http://www.omegachess.com/) is only available on line. Rachel, lacking an internet connection required to obtain these, got me [_Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_](http://www.zelda.com/gcn/index.jsp) for Gamecube, which is a fantastic game.

Thank you! So, yesterday my three-year-old niece Bethanne gave me play-dough for my birthday so that we can make scuptures together because she wants to learn how to do it. I'm making a [Dora The Explorer](http://www.dltk-kids.com/crafts/cartoons/dora_the_explorer-about.htm) figurine out of [super sculpey](http://www.sculpey.com/) to go with the ones I've made for her in past years modeled after herself and [Totoro](http://www.totoro.org/). My brother gave me [Settlers of Catan](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewitem.php3?gameid=13), which I have wanted for a long time. This board game immediately became very popular with my family. I'm very pleased that those who have given me birthday presents have made it a means for them to spend time with me. This is the best kind of gift.
