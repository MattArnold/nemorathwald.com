This meme is lifted from the livejournal of . Greg Egan, Douglas Adams, C.S. Lewis, Orson Scott Card, J. R. R. Tolkien, Harlan Ellison, Roger Zelazny, Frank Herbert, Tom Clancy, Anne Rice. The Rules: remove one name from the list, and add one author's name to the list (keeping a total of 10). Put them in order from most favorite to least favorite. (I guess non-fiction is excluded, or else the list would have comprised entirely non-fiction by now. But you decide.) I don't read Tom Clancy or Anne Rice. Frank Herbert is on this list thanks to the excellent Sci-Fi Channel miniseries. I blame Harlan Ellison for the upcoming _I, Robot_ movie because I read his old screenplay for it which was excellent and will never be used, because he had to insult a studio executive. J.R.R. Tolkien is the author of the under-appreciated book [_Farmer Giles of Ham_](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=697118"), and some miscellaneous other stuff, or something. ;^) Orson Scott Card gets credit for everything Ender-related but I don't like his alternate worlds. If I could choose any ten people from all of world history to host for dinner, C.S. Lewis, Douglas Adams and Greg Egan would be among them.
