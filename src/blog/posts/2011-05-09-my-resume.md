It feels rather crowded to me. I might bullet-point the items under each position, and allow it to span onto a second page.

It's clean, so I like that. Objectives are kinda old school. I don't use them. I like the competencies, though. This long out of undergraduate days, I'd lead with my professional experience and bump education to the bottom.
