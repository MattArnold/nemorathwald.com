Luke Ski is performing a comedy concert right here, right now, at 1:30 in the morning in CafePenguicon! There is a standing-room only audience of 45 in this party suite! Pretty girls are expressing how much they love Tux, game software developers are signing up their companies to be represented at Penguicon, the food and fine wines are plentiful, I was complimented on my espresso drinks, and Larry Niven was here an hour ago for a while! It's a fun night.
