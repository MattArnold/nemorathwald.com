Michigan Works! A temp agency found my resume there, and got me a temp to perm assignment. I am still there, and will have my official 2 years there in September.

Monster, Careerbuilder, and Jobing.com. In that order. Make sure your online resume is publicly viewable. And call all the temp agencies/headhunters around you. Every job I've ever gotten has started out from a temp agency.

I've grown somewhat cynical about hunting for work online. That said, I like the simplicity of [Simply Hired](http://www.simplyhired.com/); it aggregates resume posting, making carpet-bombing the market simpler. It also provides an aggregating email address, so you can filter the mildly spammy replies into it's own folder. Then its a matter of developing a quick eye for what doesn't fit, so you can quickly discard job offers that _don't_ match.
