["A Modest Video Game Proposal"](http://gc.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=5883) is a violent video game that should definitely be made. Miami attorney Jack Thompson is among those leading the latest American moral panic. He has offered to pay $10,000 to charity if a video game company creates a violent video game in which the player character massacres video game developers. "Target yourselves as you target others," Thompson says. Apparently he will consider this proof that video game makers sincerely believe human beings possess the ability to tell fantasy from reality. (One of the things I've noticed about people who claim no one else can tell fantasy from reality is that they tend to have some difficulty with it themselves.) Video game makers, you are passing up a huge opportunity if you don't make this game. I'm sure Jack would continue his crusade anyway, but it might be convincing to someone else that it is the video game industry that is really under attack. Even though the character in the game has to be "the father of a high school boy beaten to death with a baseball bat by a 14-year-old gamer", everyone will know he represents Jack Thompson, carrying out simulated vengeance on those Jack blames for our culture's indulgent decadence. And-- according to Jack's description which the proposed game must meet-- on their family members. Is anyone but Jack unaware that he is daydreaming out loud about the terror-spree of moral purging he longs for?
