cooked pork dumplings, and I cooked General Tso's Chicken. Fortunately we both have a high tolerance for failure. We'll probably try again someday. In the meantime we are now going to collapse in a heap, resembling the undifferentiated shreds of product we have made during the past _hours_, and begin to try to eat it. With spoons. So far I cannot fault the flavor. Only the arrangement of form leaves something to be desired. Dumplings and deep-fried breaded chicken are not intended to be _granulated substances_. We're pioneers. Wheee! Adventure! Restaurants are worth every penny.

Well, the dumplings tasted terrible, if you ask me -- greasy. But the fried rice I made with the extra dumpling meat was awesome. :D Thanks for the fun!

I can understand how you could granulate dumplings, but how the hell did you do it to chunks of chicken?

The deep-fryer basket has issues with letting go. The wire was embedded in not just the breading, but seemingly in the very _flesh_, somehow. "Granulating" may be a less appropriate term than "shredding". In both the dumplings and the frying, I learned a lot and have high hopes for next time.

Ah, temperature control problems - oil needs to be a bit hotter. (Thank you, St. Alton, may bless and keep my spatula from harm...) -- Brian out --

Could the temperature be _too_ hot? It was maxed out.

If things are coming out too greasy, that usually indicates the oil temp is too low. I would check it with a good kitchen thermometer - for batter frying it should be around 350-365 F.
