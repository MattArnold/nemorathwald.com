_The Seven Habits Of Highly Successful People_, Stephen Covey You've heard the adage "a butterfly's wings in the Amazon stir a breeze yada yada yada, there's a hurricane in New York." There's no way to know which precise flutters will lead to a specific storm. What I'm doing about this is to make a [mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) of words that keep cropping up again and again in my long-term dreams. As long as I keep fluttering toward these associations, I'll increase my odds of landing somewhere that I want to get to. I don't have to know yet which one of my dreams it will be, or what route would lead straight there from here. Web administration, Python, and Flash are good examples of words that keep coming up. Given how many of my ideas end when I don't know how to do one or more of those things, it's clear that I'll benefit from improving my skills in these areas. To achieve those subgoals, I need some kind of structured learning, or I'll never actually devote the time. And what do you know. I just now fluttered across [something I had been hoping to create for myself for quite a long time.](http://coffeeghost.net/pybat/python_cheatsheet.png)

That's a nifty cheat sheet, even to a somewhat experienced programmer. And if we're leaving favorite inspirational quotes: "Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions which is hard." - The Doctor. And my own addendum to that, sometimes the answer is yet another question.

Nice cheat sheet. Also interesting idea, with the tracking long-term goal/dream words.
