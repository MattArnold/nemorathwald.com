**Announcement** I get to be on staff for [PyCon](http://pycon.org/2009/about/), the world conference of the Python programming language, in Chicago! Tuesday March 24 through Sunday March 29! Which means all-expenses-paid for me! For all six days! If I'm willing to work almost non-stop during those days! Which I am!
