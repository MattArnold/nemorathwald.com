It hasn't been a banner week. As I drove home, the temp agency called to say today was my last day at my temp job. They said I worked fast but lacked accuracy. I guess I could look on the bright side. 1. I hope it will remove office pressures from my friendship with my coworker. 2. I probably no longer have to figure out the puzzles, obstacles, and vague responsibilities associated with doing that type of work, or how to un-demoralize myself about them. 3. It probably frees up time to hunker down and pay all my attention to shepherding the ConFusion program book in the upcoming week, make a Flash animation for practice, and create a couple of other highly interesting projects. The agent said she has rarely seen test scores as good as mine, and is shopping me around to two other clients currently.

Sorry to hear about it. That truly does suck. Just remember Dan's first rule in dealing with salespeople. And let's face it temp agents are little more than people salespeople. 1. Never, ever trust a salesperson. My typical strategy would be to play along with your current temp agency and have two or more others looking for jobs for you at the same time. The only caveat there is you may end up being submitted to the same client by more than one agency. Not really a negative if you play it right though.

That is unfortunate but may be fortunate at the same time. I am going to go with fortunate since you will hopefully be placed in a different one soon.

WOW! I'm flabbergasted, and not sure what to say. I hope your next assignment is more in the vain of what you envision for yourself. I'm not sure my pressures will be lifted, in fact, I'm sure they won't be. But you do have the time you need to correctly organize the cons you so love. Good luck with them!
