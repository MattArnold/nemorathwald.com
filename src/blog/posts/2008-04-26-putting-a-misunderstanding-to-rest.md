Many of you have been asking if signs and portents pointed to a pre-Penguicon power struggle of some kind among the convention organizers. To lay it to rest, there absolutely was not. That was a misinterpretation of the signs and portents. Outsiders flocked to become insiders, with fresh ideas, change, evolution, and we welcomed them to our parties and barbecues. The Penguicon 2009 Concom is a well-oiled machine, composed of those from Penguicon who have been reaching unprecedented levels of friendship and good will at SMOS dinners over the last year. (Thank you to for inventing that stroke of genius.) We're getting new convention organizers every month or week, many of which have never attended cons before. So there you go! I invite you to contact me personally if you feel the need for more discussion, or if you hear someone who you feel needs to hear it from the horse's mouth.
