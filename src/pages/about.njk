        <p>I'm the president of i3Detroit maker space in Ferndale.</p>
        <p>For almost 20 years, I served in almost every position in Penguicon, a combination of a science fiction convention with an open source software conference.</p>
        <p>I have been podcasting for almost 20 years. From 2016 through 2020, I narrated UNSONG by Scott Alexander. From 2020 through 2024, I narrated the books of David Chapman.</p>
        <p>I build giant parade puppets.</p>
        <p>I start and run not-for-profit events like Fluidity Forum, a small annual conference centered on metamodernity, sense-making, and thinking-about-thinking.</p>
        <p>I develop board games, such as Overworld, GaiaVora, and Ruhana. The Kickstarter for Overworld raised $49K.</p>
        <p>I'm a polyamorous atheist, intentionally living in a house with other adults in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
        <p>I'm skeptical, non-religious, and content with how I relate to the world. At the same time, I'm endlessly curious in my experiments combining art, ritual, and play to create memorable experiences for groups.</p>
        <p>I was a graphic designer for a decade, before changing careers into front-end web development, which I did for 12 years (2013 to the present).</p>
